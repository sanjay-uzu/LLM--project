Li Auto&rsquo;s December deliveries came in at 21,233 vehicles, marking a record monthly performance. In the fourth quarter, the company sold 46,319 cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nio, which recently warned of a shortfall, had a final tally of 15,815 vehicles, a monthly record&nbsp;for December, and 40,052 units for the quarter. Last Tuesday, the Shanghai-based EV marker <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/12/30200856/why-nio-shares-are-skidding-in-premarket-session-today\">lowered its quarterly deliveries guidance</a> from 43,000-48,000 units to 38,500-39,500 units, citing production and delivery challenges along with supply chain constraints due to the outbreak of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in many major Chinese cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XPeng sold 11,292 units for the month and 22,204 units for the quarter.

Nio&rsquo;s year-over-year and quarterly growth stood at 50.8% and 11.6%, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XPeng reported a 29.4% year-over-year decline in December deliveries, but sales jumped 94% quarter-over-quarter, thanks to an easier comparison. The company reported anemic deliveries of 5,811 units in November due to COVID-19 disruptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Model-wise Tally: </strong> Li Auto said deliveries of its Li L9 and Li L8 both exceeded 10,000 units, solidifying its market position in the 300,000 yuan &ndash; 500,000 yuan ($43,492-$72,486) price segment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We set another monthly record in December with 21,233 deliveries and became the fastest emerging new energy automaker in China to surpass the 20,000 monthly delivery mark,&rdquo; the company said in a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nio&rsquo;s December sales included 6,842 SUVs and 8,973 sedans. The ES7 accounted for the bulk of the SUV sales, and in the sedan category, the company sold 1,379 ET7 premium sedans and 7,594 ET5&nbsp;budget sedans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XPeng, meanwhile, sold 4,020 flagship G9 SUVs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nio, XPeng and Li Auto shares ended 2022 down 69.22%, 80.25% and 36.45%, respectively.

Given that China represents a bulk of the company&rsquo;s global tally, the tidings from the smaller upstarts bode well for the company.

Here are some ways you can reboot your relationship with marijuana in the new year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As another year comes to a close it is time to contemplate the things we did well and those that we can improve upon. Many people make resolutions this time of year, and others opt to simply improve upon the past and slowly develop some new habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li class=\"views-field-title\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/12/30130720/how-to-preserve-your-weed-through-the-winter\" title=\"How To Preserve Your Weed Through The Winter\">How To Preserve Your Weed Through The Winter</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a regular cannabis user, you might have some new habits you are trying to form, or maybe one or two old ones you are trying to break. There are all sorts of ways you can incorporate new positive habits into your cannabis-friendly lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you want to cut down on how much you spend on weed, or learn more about what you are smoking, this list of the top five habits to develop in the New Year will have you ready to embrace next year with an optimistic and focused mindset.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Educate Yourself on Your Local Weed&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>According to<a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/284135/percentage-americans-smoke-marijuana.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" Gallup\">&nbsp;Gallup</a>, 16% of Americans use marijuana and 48% have at least tried it. While this accounts for millions of people, only a small percentage of these users are likely to know much more than the classical differences between &ldquo;sativa&rdquo; and &ldquo;indica.&rdquo; If you regularly use cannabis, make it a point to learn more about exactly what you are smoking.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li class=\"views-field-title\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/12/29773696/day-or-night-which-promotes-a-better-high\" title=\"Day Or Night: Which Promotes A Better High?\">Day Or Night: Which Promotes A Better High?</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider reading about the growers in your state and understanding the strains that you smoke. You might even learn why certain strains thrive in your region. Research<a href=\"https://thefreshtoast.com/cannabis/landrace-strains-the-og-weed-strains-that-started-it-all/\" title=\" landrace\">&nbsp;landrace</a>&nbsp;strains, and find out which growers are using environmentally friendly and organic growing techniques, and try and support those brands. People have grown much more conscious about the type of food they consume, and perhaps it is time to do the same when it comes to weed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Look Into Healthier Ways to Consume Weed</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, marijuana is considered healthier than lots of its alternatives, like alcohol for socialization and opioids for pain, but smoking it is not helping your lungs. Smoking pretty much anything damages your lungs, and marijuana is no exception. As we previously<a href=\"https://thefreshtoast.com/cannabis/is-smoking-weed-bad-for-your-lungs/\" title=\" reported\">&nbsp;reported</a>, &ldquo;Smoking weed leads to the deposit of four times the amount of tar than smoking tobacco, and may increase the risk of lung cancer.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try reducing the amount of marijuana you smoke, and switching to some lung-friendly alternatives. Edibles are an obvious choice. But if you are looking for more fast-acting products, consider cannabis beverages and alcohol-based tinctures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Embrace Activities With Mindful Breathing</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to seeking alternatives to smoking and even vaping marijuana, you can also work to get the most out of your breathing. Mindful breathing has all sorts of benefits that can enhance the lives of any cannabis user.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li class=\"views-field-title\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/12/29705358/smoking-weed-vs-edibles-which-is-better-for-your-brain\" title=\"Smoking Weed Vs. Edibles: Which Is Better For Your Brain?\">Smoking Weed Vs. Edibles: Which Is Better For Your Brain?</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to some simple mindful breathing exercises, activities like yoga and&nbsp;meditation&nbsp;also incorporate breath exercise into many of their practices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to lowering anxiety, mindful breathing can, according to<a href=\"https://www.insider.com/guides/health/mental-health/why-is-mindful-breathing-important\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" Insider\">&nbsp;Insider</a>, &ldquo;help with burnout, provide certain types of pain relief, and decrease negative thinking.&rdquo; So give breathing exercises and mindful breathing a chance. It can help your lungs, and have all sorts of other benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Try Folding Exercise Into Your Weed Routine</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Exercise is at the top of almost everyone&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s resolutions list. Developing an exercise habit, however, is not always that easy. Exercise can be tedious, difficult and altogether dreadful if it feels like an obligation. But some find incorporating marijuana into exercise helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we recently&nbsp;reported, there are several benefits of incorporating cannabis into your fitness routine, including minimizing pain and inflammation, and boosting your energy. In fact, marijuana can be helpful at mitigating all sorts of negative feelings you associate with exercise. So try a non-hazardous and low impact cardio workout with marijuana and see if you find it easier to achieve your New Year&rsquo;s fitness goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Schedule Seasonal Tolerance Breaks</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use cannabis pretty much every day you have almost certainly noticed that over time you need more and more procure to feel the effects. In fact, you might find that the high you once felt now escapes you altogether. This is common with most substances, as our bodies develop tolerances to the substance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you take a tolerance break you are basically setting the clock back to day one. A tolerance break once every few months can have lots of benefits. A tolerance break can help you save money, since you won&rsquo;t need as much weed to get high. It will also make your high more intense since you have given your body a break. Scheduling these breaks and sticking to them is the most effective way to ensure your tolerance does not get out of control, or lead to dependence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-bc00dc2a-7fff-64ab-069f-1fa3cfde0fb7\">Nuestro contenido en Espa&ntilde;ol:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://elplanteo.com/fume-demasiada-marihuana/\">C&oacute;mo Bajar el Efecto de la Mota</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://elplanteo.com/marihuana-y-tolerancia-como-funciona-y-como-controlarla/\">Tolerancia a la Marihuana</a>:&nbsp; C&oacute;mo Funciona y C&oacute;mo Controlarla</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://elplanteo.com/hierbas-curativas-que-puedes-fumar-aparte-del-cannabis/\">Hierbas que Se Pueden Fumar</a> (Adem&aacute;s de la Marihuana)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

She rose to stardom as Disney&#39;s &ldquo;Hannah Montana.&rdquo; When she moved on from the series, she successfully shrugged off her America&rsquo;s sweetheart image, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUvu1mlWco\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">singing songs about molly</a> (<a href=\"https://psychedelicspotlight.com/psychedelic-education/what-are-psychedelics/mdma/\">MDMA</a>), gyrating half-naked on a wrecking ball, and doing anything she could to raise the eyebrows of every soccer mom in suburbia. Now, at the ripe old age of 28, Cyrus is every bit as rebellious. She&rsquo;s sporting a blonde shag and red lipstick-lined sneer and flashing her bare breasts in the January 2021 issue of Rolling Stone. Cyrus says she feels &ldquo;very weighted and grounded. I&rsquo;m free, but I feel responsibility. I take my mental and physical health a lot more seriously than I ever did before.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When she turned 26, Cyrus says she decided to quit drugs and alcohol, not because she was addicted, but because she feared becoming part of the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/the-27-club-a-brief-history-17853/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">27 club</a>.&rdquo; In November of that year, she underwent emergency surgery for Reinke&rsquo;s edema, a condition that causes swelling of the vocal cords.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afterwards, &ldquo;I was pretty much fully sober,&rdquo; she says. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. It triggered her depression and anxiety which led her to drinking again. That stopped her from making &ldquo;concrete statements,&rdquo; adding that she would &ldquo;possibly take mushrooms,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I did take ayahuasca, and I really, really liked that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ayahuasca&#39;s Healing Power</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ayahuasca, the hallucinogenic brew made from the leaves and stalks of certain South American plants containing DMT (dimethyltryptamine) and MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor), is all the rage among celebrities including Chelsea Handler, Lindsay Lohan, and Sting. The brew triggers intense hallucinations; some people say they also experience deep emotions that lead to enormous healing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"703\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/73Ys9R-qaco\" width=\"395\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ClTpFu8Dg7U/\">video on Instagram</a> or on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6VX4EQx1bw\">YouTube</a>.</em></p>\r\n<!-- wp:core/embed {\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.instagram.com\\/p\\/ClTpFu8Dg7U\\/\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"instagram\",\"responsive\":true,\"align\":\"center\"} --><!-- /wp:core/embed -->\r\n\r\n<p>Studies have back up those theories. Among them are some carried out by the <a href=\"https://psychedelicspotlight.com/5-meo-dmt-depression/\">Beckley/Sant Pau Research Programme</a>, which found that ayahuasca use leads to an increase in several key traits associated with mindfulness, a state which has been shown to improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, grief and PTSD. It&rsquo;s helped Cyrus come to terms with her own struggles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cyrus&rsquo; experimentation with the ceremonial psychedelic happened at her home in 2013 with Flaming Lips&rsquo; leader Wayne Coyne. The two had been collaborating on tunes for Cyrus&rsquo; Dead Petz record at the time, Coyne told <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/flaming-lips-talk-work-ethic-taking-ayahuasca-with-miley-cyrus-128748/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Rolling Stone</a>. Cyrus later told the <a href=\"https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/the-long-winding-interview-with-miley-cyrus/?action=click&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a> that the experience was healing. &ldquo;I loved what it did for me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cyrus said that snakes grabbed her and took her to &ldquo;Mother Ayahuasca&rdquo;, who walked her through her entire trip. &ldquo;It was pretty crazy,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I loved it, though.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cyrus says she doesn&rsquo;t plan to try the ceremonial psychedelic again, but the drug remains dear to her heart. &ldquo;Ayahuasca was definitely one of my favorite drugs I&rsquo;ve ever done.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo of <a href=\"https://elplanteo.com/por-que-la-ayahuasca-es-la-droga-favorita-de-miley-cyrus/\">Miley Cyrus</a> via <a href=\"http://ElPlanteo.com\">ElPlanteo.com</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n"

They speak of the <strong>perpetually cyclical nature of life</strong>: of birth, death, decay, and rebirth.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview with the London-based independent outlet, <strong>Jessica Hundley spoke about the different aspects of our relationship with plants</strong>, such as symbolism, psychedelia, pacifism, witchcraft, rituals, surrealism, and healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"plant_magic_book.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/plant_magic_book.png\" style=\"height:542px; width:395px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Find an image gallery at the end of the article)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Symbolism</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In her dialogue with Dazed, Hundley referred to the symbolism of plants present in religion and in our myths and legends centuries ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Humans have been associating elements of nature with deeply symbolic meanings for thousands of years&hellip; <strong>Eve is eating the apple from the Tree of Knowledge, Persephone&#39;s pomegranate or the lotus representing the process of attaining enlightenment</strong>, rising from the mud through the water into the air. Not only plants but also cacti and fungi, they are all represented in symbolism within our first mythologies and religious practices&rdquo;, explained the author.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And she continued: &quot;We also often find <strong>parallels between our own lives within the cycle of growth and the seasons</strong>: the root, the stem, the flowering, the decay, and death, coming back to be reborn.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Psychedelic</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the writer, producer, and director specialized in music, cinema, counterculture, and psychedelia, referring to the spectacular psychedelic experiences that arise from the consumption of certain plant species.<br />\r\n&ldquo;<strong>Almost all psychedelic experiences are directly related to ingesting various medicinal plants, cacti, or mushrooms.</strong> The ergot mushroom, for example, is one of the main components of <a href=\"http://elplanteo.com/como-se-hace-el-lsd/\">LSD</a>. Visions and patterns associated with the ingestion of <a href=\"https://elplanteo.com/que-es-el-peyote/\">peyote</a>, San Pedro <a href=\"https://elplanteo.com/mescalina-todo-lo-que-siempre-quisiste-saber-y-nunca-te-animaste-a-preguntar/\">cactus</a>, or <a href=\"https://elplanteo.com/ayahuasca-todo-lo-que-necesitas-saber/\">ayahuasca</a> are just a few of the <a href=\"https://elplanteo.com/medicina-vegetal-africana/\">plant medicine</a> rituals that have resulted in generations of indigenous art: visionary works executed in media such as textiles, clay, and jewelry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pacifism</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The term <strong>&lsquo;flower power&rsquo;</strong> was first coined by the great American poet and activist Allen Ginsberg. It&#39;s such a powerful phrase, connoting the <strong>power of nonviolent protest, peaceful radicalism, and revolution</strong>,&quot; Hundley said.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Witchcraft</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, Hundley revealed that there are many images in the book that evoke the long relationship between plants and magic: images of mushroom-shaped stone totem poles in Central America and also reproductions of contemporary works such as performance art and sculptures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And she added: &ldquo;Herbalism and green witchcraft are inherently a part of almost all witchcraft practices.<strong> Within most pagan traditions, you will find a deep relationship with plants and herbs, which are considered potent healers, as well as nature-focused ceremonies, where the earth itself is a goddess, the source of generative power and beauty. </strong>Although not necessarily identifying as &#39;witches,&#39; artists such as Megan Boyd, Elena Stonaker, Lani Trock and Ariana Papademetropoulos certainly embrace a distinctly feminine power within their artistic representations of plants and flowers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Rituals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Who can deny that plants and flowers have had (and still) a fundamental place in our rites and ceremonies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<strong>We have been integrating plants and flowers into initiation rites, marriage, and death ceremonies in every culture since recorded history, and probably longer! </strong>The book celebrates this symbiotic relationship and explores how we accept plants not only as markers of life transitions but also as methods to expand consciousness,&quot; says Hundley.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Surrealism</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In Plant Magick, the surrealist works play with dreamlike landscapes, as in the &quot;Meditative Rose&quot; by Salvador Dal&iacute; or the work of Magritte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<strong>We have focused particularly on the work of Surrealist women</strong>, the circle of women who pushed the boundaries of form in their distinctively feminine way. In <em>Plant Magick</em>, this is beautifully illustrated in the work of Remedios Varo and the wonderful photography of the painter and theater designer Leonor Fini captured at a party with her cloth flower as a mask&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Healing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Hundley&#39;s work also seeks to awaken feelings of care for the environment and ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related to the above, she affirmed: &ldquo;Interacting with nature in any way: taking care of a plant, walking through a forest, taking care of a garden, all these experiences can be meditative and healing. <strong>The hope is that by cultivating a deeper connection with plants, whether it&#39;s watering a houseplant on your windowsill or exploring a park or nature preserve, we&#39;ll be better able to care for ourselves and our planet.</strong>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Plant Magick: Image Gallery</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a1.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a1.png\" style=\"height:581px; width:844px\" /><img alt=\"a2.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a2.png\" style=\"height:496px; width:725px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a3.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a3.png\" style=\"height:496px; width:726px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a4.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a4.png\" style=\"height:496px; width:725px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a5.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a5.png\" style=\"height:496px; width:726px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a6.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a6.png\" style=\"height:467px; width:674px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a7.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a7.png\" style=\"height:492px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a8.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a8.png\" style=\"height:470px; width:702px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a9.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a9.png\" style=\"height:467px; width:703px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a10.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a10.png\" style=\"height:477px; width:693px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a11.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a11.png\" style=\"height:493px; width:752px\" /><img alt=\"a12.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a12.png\" style=\"height:494px; width:724px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a13.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a13.png\" style=\"height:487px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a14.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a14.png\" style=\"height:467px; width:699px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a15.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u1084344/a15.png\" style=\"height:473px; width:704px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Gallery images are <a href=\"https://www.taschen.com/pages/es/catalogue/art/all/08020/facts.plant_magick_the_library_of_esoterica.htm\">Taschen</a>&rsquo;s property.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Get your daily dose of&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"http://www.benzinga.com/cannabis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">cannabis news</a></em><em>&nbsp;on Benzinga Cannabis.

Production disruption due to a COVID-19 outbreak shuttered the company&rsquo;s Giga Shanghai plant for about a month, starting in late March. After resuming production, the ramp-up was slow amid the zero-COVID policy in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla&#39;s Giga Shanghai closed down yet again in July for factory upgrades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even as things were returning to normalcy, the country was hit with a fresh COVID wave in late 2022. Tesla did not disclose any production disruption, but domestic upstarts <strong>XPeng, Inc. </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/XPEV#NYSE\">XPEV</a>) and <strong>Nio, Inc. </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NIO#NYSE\">NIO</a>) complained of production shortfalls due to the COVID-19 situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the demand side of the equation is apparently impacted, going by a slew of price cuts Tesla announced since late October. COVID-19 along with domestic competition has begun to weigh down on Tesla. Future Fund&rsquo;s <strong>Gary Black</strong>, who has delved into Tesla&rsquo;s woes multiple times recently, has said a lack of lower-priced cars in China is hurting the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla&rsquo;s China sales came in at 120,576 units in the third quarter, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association, which is about 35% of the company&#39;s&nbsp;total global sales of 343,830 units. Aside from this, about 67,741 made-in-China cars were exported for sale during the quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XPeng, Nio and <strong>Li Auto, Inc.&rsquo;s </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/LI#NASDAQ\">LI</a>) December and fourth-quarter numbers released earlier on Sunday showed that these <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/01/30247094/nio-li-auto-clock-record-december-deliveries-xpengs-sales-rebound-what-that-means-for-tesla\">domestic electric vehicle startups prevailed </a>despite the tough COVID-19 restrictions. This gives a reason to hope for a better-than-expected number from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an internal email sent to employees last week, CEO <strong>Elon Musk </strong>urged them to go in for a big quarter-end push.<br />\r\n<em>See also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-tesla-stock\">How to Invest In Tesla (TSLA) Stock</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expectations Temper: </strong> Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who is bullish on Tesla, said in a recent note that he expects fourth-quarter deliveries of 399,000 units. Buy-side consensus is between 410,000-425,000 units, the analyst said, citing the firm&rsquo;s conversations with investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla&#39;s investor relations-compiled consensus estimate for fourth-quarter deliveries is 417,957 units, data shared by Black shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$TSLA</a> IR-compiled 4Q consensus deliveries is out 418.0K.

This would mark a 41.7% increase from the 936,172 cars delivered in 2021. Tesla has a long-term delivery growth target of 50%. Despite the miss for the year, the fourth quarter number will likely be a new quarterly record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where&rsquo;s The Stock Headed Near Term? </strong> Tesla stock is coming off a tough year, having fallen about 65% in 2022. After bottoming at $108.24 (its lowest price since mid-August 2020)&nbsp;on Wednesday, the stock picked up slight upward momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Better-than-expected fourth-quarter deliveries could add strength to this move. On the contrary, a weak number will likely lead to a reversal. The next catalyst could be the fourth-quarter results due in late January. The string of price cuts, not only in China but also in the U.S. and Europe, do not bode well for margins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the stock opens for trading on Tuesday, Jan. 3, $110 could serve as support on any potential downside. Further down, the stock has support around the $94.5 level. In the eventuality of the recent bullish momentum accelerating, the stock could face resistance around the $129 and $146 levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla closed Friday&rsquo;s session up 1.12% at $123.28, according to <a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">Benzinga Pro data.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Read next:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/22/12/30244830/teslas-pricing-power-will-suffer-due-to-new-irs-rules-for-ev-sales-credit-analyst-s\">Tesla&#39;s Pricing Power Will Suffer Due To New IRS Rules For EV Sales Credit, Analyst Says</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo: Courtesy of Shutterstock.</em></p>\r\n"

Italy&rsquo;s Army is in charge of growing and producing top-grade medical marijuana and is&nbsp;using secret nutrients to cultivate cannabis for&nbsp;those suffering from illnesses like cancer or Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, the Army plans to produce at least 1,500 pounds of weed to cover nearly half the amount required annually to meet the country&rsquo;s medical marijuana needs. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The next step is self-sufficiency &mdash; that&rsquo;s our ambition,&rdquo; said Nicola Latorre, who leads the Italian Defense Industries Agency, which oversees the operations. The agency, an arm of Italy&#39;s&nbsp;Defense Ministry, handles the commercialization of the&nbsp;enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also in 2023, the Army intends&nbsp;to produce cannabis-infused olive oil, which users can take in drop form.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Earliest Medical Marijuana Market&nbsp;In Europe</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy is one of the earliest and largest medical marijuana (MMJ)&nbsp;markets in Europe&nbsp;with&nbsp;double-digit growth for the past several years, yet it has not been able to meet&nbsp;patients&#39; needs. Now the Defense Ministry has a monopoly over domestic cultivation in an effort to beef up production, which it&#39;s doing&nbsp;at an anonymous-looking Army facility on the edge of Florence, reports Defense News.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the Army can&#39;t&nbsp;produce is still being&nbsp;imported from the Netherlands, Canada, Denmark and Germany.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why The Army, You Ask? Experience And Efficiency</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In its effort to become self-sufficient in medical research&nbsp;and production...who better to put in charge but the Army? After all, the Army&nbsp;has been in the pharmaceutical business for decades during which time it&nbsp;has been&nbsp;producing&nbsp;chemical warfare antidotes and malaria pills for soldiers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What we can do in Florence is produce a highly standardized product so the dosage is unvaried, at the same price as we are now paying for imports,&rdquo; said Col. Gabriele Picchioni, head of the facility that was launched in 2014&nbsp;and has been increasing its output annually&nbsp;thanks to more growing rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Latorre noted that his agency&rsquo;s activities facilitated a growing shift toward military involvement in the public health sector, which was&nbsp;on display during the&nbsp;pandemic when Army personnel set up treatment tents and transported vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;COVID made us see how public health is tied to the defense of the country and its security,&rdquo; Latorre said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cannabis company&nbsp;in Italy</strong>: In 2019, Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ACB#NASDAQ\">ACB</a>)&nbsp;was selected as the only winner of the Italian government&rsquo;s public tender to supply medical cannabis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Army also manufactures so-called orphan drugs -&nbsp;medicines for rare diseases or conditions that big companies ignore because of the low production rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo: Brittanica</em></p>\r\n"

While she trimmed her bets on most EV names in her portfolio <em>vis-a-vis</em> the end of last year, interestingly, she loaded up on the stock that saw the maximum hammering. And no, it&rsquo;s not Tesla!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s a look at how Ark&#39;s holdings of EV players have changed since the beginning of 2022:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Tesla</strong>: Compared to the end of Dec. 2021, Ark has trimmed its bets on Tesla as on Dec. 23, 2022. The fund reduced its holdings by 1.13 million shares in the said period, <a href=\"https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-tsla\">according </a>to Cathiesark.com. This comes in the wake of the stock price drop of 65% in the same period. Apart from the general market rout, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/12/30139251/elon-musks-twitter-rolls-out-blue-for-business-heres-what-it-will-offer-brands-employees\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong>&rsquo;s <strong>Twitter </strong>purchase</a> has acted as a big overhang on the stock over the last few months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the website, the bulk of the sale came between March and May with some more sales conducted in August and September. However, recently, Ark has started buying Tesla shares again and since mid-December, it has loaded up over 189,000 shares of the EV-maker <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/22/12/30169557/cathie-wood-splurges-on-tesla-for-6th-straight-day-as-weekly-purchase-crosses-23m-amid-s\">at an estimated valuation of over $23 million.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wood has previously said she estimates Tesla stock to hit the $3,000 mark by 2025.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Xpeng Inc.</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/XPEV#NYSE\">XPEV</a>): Despite an 80% fall in its stock price compared to the end of last year, Ark has increased its holdings of this Chinese EV-maker in the said period. Compared to end-December&nbsp;2021, Ark has increased its Xpeng stake by over 317,000 shares, according to Cathiesark.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per Wood, &ldquo;high-profit margins&rdquo; are not a good thing, a reason why her investment firm has stayed away from such companies. &ldquo;So Xpeng and Nio, we have ... but they&#39;re very low margin,&rdquo; Wood had stated. &ldquo;It&#39;s all about next-gen transportation in a world where you know human-driven cars are still, relative to the eligible drivers, still (a) very low percentage. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/22/04/26466908/cathie-wood-on-why-ark-is-buying-shares-in-tesla-chinese-rivals-nio-xpeng\">So, we&#39;re interested there,&rdquo; she said.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Nio Inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NIO#NYSE\">NIO</a>): During end-March, Ark invested in Nio shares for the first time, scooping up over 420,000 shares of the EV-maker. However, since then, the fund has trimmed its holdings by over 80,000. The share price dropped over 44% in the said period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nio is the 35<sup>th</sup> largest holding of the <strong>ARK Autonomous Tech. &amp; Robotics ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ARKQ#NYSE\">ARKQ</a>) with a weight of 0.49%, according to data on the company&rsquo;s website at the time of writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. BYD Co.</strong> (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BYDDY#OTC\">BYDDY</a>) (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BYDDF#OTC\">BYDDF</a>): The <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>-backed EV-maker&#39;s stock has seen a relatively low decline in its stock compared to some of its peers. Since the end of last year, the stock has lost just over 27%. However, Ark, which holds the unsponsored ADRs (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BYDDY#OTC\">BYDDY</a>) of the company through the ARK Autonomous Tech. &amp; Robotics ETF, has trimmed its holdings by over 37,000 shares in the said period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, BYD is the 17<sup>th</sup> largest holding of the fund with a weight of 1.73%.

Then there was a debate over whether rising inflation was due to bad policies or bad luck,&rdquo; he said. Roubini said he disagreed with the consensus and said the recession would be deep.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No, this is not going to be a short and shallow recession, it&rsquo;s going to be deep and protracted,&rdquo; he&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b86825e3-5e34-4817-801f-0e0c190bcbbb\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>&nbsp;in an interview with the Financial Times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Larry Summers:&nbsp;</strong>Former Treasury Secretary<strong>&nbsp;Lawrence H.

Zoom Video Communications Inc</strong>&nbsp; (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ZM#NASDAQ\">ZM</a>): Shares of the technology company have lost over 64% since the beginning of the year. At the time of writing, Ark held over $645 million in Zoom&rsquo;s shares via two different funds with the stock being the second largest holding among Wood&rsquo;s funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November, Ark Invest analyst <strong>Will Summerlin </strong>had said in a report that Zoom Video&#39;s stock could skyrocket to $1,500 in 2026, compounding at an annual rate of 76%. The valuation was based on the fund&#39;s open-source research and model. By 2026, Ark expects at least one person on any Zoom call to be a paying user, with enhanced Zoom functionality. In bear- and bull-case scenarios, about 20% and 80%, respectively, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/22/06/27623141/cathie-woods-ark-invest-expects-this-covid-play-to-appreciate-about-1-200-by-2026-2\">will convert to paying users by 2026, according to the firm.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Tesla Inc.&nbsp;</strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>): No matter what Wall Street thinks about Tesla stock, the EV-maker has always found a big supporter in Wood. Tesla shares, which witnessed a significant plunge in the last one month following its CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong>&rsquo;s acquisition of <strong>Twitter</strong>, have lost over 30% since end-November. The stock is the biggest loser amongst the top three holdings of Ark, having declined over 69% since the beginning of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the recent plunge, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/22/12/30169557/cathie-wood-splurges-on-tesla-for-6th-straight-day-as-weekly-purchase-crosses-23m-amid-s\">Ark&nbsp;has scooped up Tesla shares relentlessly.</a> Since mid-December, Wood&rsquo;s funds have loaded up over 189,000 shares of the EV-maker at an estimated valuation of over $23 million, based on Friday&rsquo;s closing price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Read Next: </strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/12/30196998/russia-may-hike-crude-oil-exports-if-eu-ban-on-its-fuel-imports-results-in-lower-refinery-output\">Russia May Hike Crude Oil Exports If EU Ban On Its Fuel Imports Results In Lower Refinery Output</a></em></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p><strong>UpHealth</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/UPH#NYSE\">UPH</a>) brought in sales totaling $38.67 million during Q3 according to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/?utm_source=insights\">data provided by Benzinga Pro</a>. However, earnings decreased 1228.39%, resulting in a loss of $165.58 million. In Q2, UpHealth brought in $43.67 million in sales but lost $12.46 million in earnings. </p>\n<h3>Why Is ROCE Significant?</h3>\n<p>Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, UpHealth posted an ROCE of -1.26%.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. </p>\n<p>ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows UpHealth is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. </p>\n<p>For UpHealth, a negative ROCE ratio of -1.26% suggests that management may not be effectively allocating their capital. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns; poor capital allocation can be a leech on the performance of a company over time.</p>\n<h3>Analyst Predictions</h3>\n<p>UpHealth reported Q3 earnings per share at $-0.5/share, which beat analyst predictions of $-0.74/share.</p>\n<p>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</p>"

And, on, it goes,&rdquo; wrote Blanchard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Replying to Blanchard&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/10/29473152/paul-krugman-gives-verdict-on-us-handling-of-pandemic-shock-inflation-under-biden-pretty-good-possib\">take on inflation, Krugman responded</a>, saying, &ldquo;One way to think about inflation is that it&#39;s like a sports event where everyone stands up to get a better view of the action &mdash; which is collectively self-defeating.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Krugman provided an analogy saying controlling inflation by inducing a recession is like &quot;stopping the action on the field until everyone sits down again&quot; and that although it works, it has a cost. &ldquo;Much better if we could get collective agreement by everyone to sit down without stopping the game. That&#39;s hard to achieve, but not always impossible,&rdquo; Krugman tweeted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Israel&rsquo;s Strategy:</strong> Krugman cited the sharp disinflation strategy adopted by the Israeli government in 1985 to reduce inflation from a whopping 500% per annum. &ldquo;The more or less painless 1985 Bruno disinflation in Israel was pretty much exactly that: all the major parties agreed to stop trying to leapfrog each other, and inflation came down right away,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/22/11/29674430/paul-krugman-thinks-soft-landing-is-looking-increasingly-plausible-after-inflation-\">Krugman pointed out</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The noted economist said that the 1968 Phelps paper, which simultaneously and independently introduced the natural rate hypothesis, worked pretty much that way &mdash;&nbsp;&ldquo;Staggered wage-setting, and in a hot labor market everyone trying to get ahead of everyone else &mdash; with inflation possibly getting entrenched if everyone expected it to persist.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Read Next: </strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/01/30247530/us-december-jobs-report-may-show-labor-market-remains-tight-the-projected-numbers\">US December Jobs Report May Show Labor Market Remains Tight: The Projected Numbers</a></em></p>\r\n"

Several new collections also launched in 2022 and have climbed their way up the all-time sales volume leaderboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> NFTs continued to be a trending topic in the cryptocurrency sector and one of Benzinga&#39;s many areas of coverage&nbsp;in 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From hosting a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4k0fH8EgI3Zmyo_1GXYeMxpPyOEemQax\">NFT show on YouTube</a>; Twitter Spaces discussing Web3; and our first&nbsp;in-person crypto <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/crypto/\">event in New York City</a> in 2022, NFTs were top of mind for Benzinga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the new year begins, here&rsquo;s a look at the top 10 NFT collections by sales volume in 2022. The list uses data from <a href=\"https://www.cryptoslam.io/\">CryptoSlam </a>through Dec. 20, 2022 and was reported by <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/116995/biggest-nft-collections-2022\">Decrypt</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Bored Ape Yacht Club,</strong> $1.57 billion: The original collection from <strong>Yuga Labs </strong>was the top-selling NFT collection in 2022 with over $1.5 billion in sales volume. The collection, which minted in April 2021, ranks second of all-time, behind only Axie Infinity for NFT sales volume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/03/26175548/apecoin-launched-here-are-the-details-and-how-to-get-it\"> launch of <strong>ApeCoin </strong></a>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">APE</a>) and Otherdeed for Otherside NFTs were among the catalysts that helped keep Bored Ape Yacht Club front and center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Mutant Ape Yacht Club</strong>, $1.14 billion: Like Bored Ape Yacht Club, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club collection likely saw increased interest in 2022 thanks to the launch of ApeCoin and Otherdeeds, two items that were allocated to holders of Yuga Labs assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mutant Ape Yacht Club has more items in its collection and a lower entry price than Bored Ape Yacht Club, which may have made it an investment or trade for more people in 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Otherdeed for Otherside,</strong> $1.1 billion: The newest collection from Yuga Labs<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/05/26920672/bored-ape-otherside-deed-land-sale-sells-out-burns-over-100-million-in-ethereum-heres-the-\"> launched in 2022</a> with a claim for all Bored Ape and Mutant Ape holders and a public mint that saw massive demand. The NFT collection, which will play a key part in the Otherside metaverse from Yuga Labs, became the third launch from Yuga Labs to pass sales volume of $1 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Azuki, </strong>$849.9 million: Launched in January, Azuki was one of the biggest success stories of 2022 and ranks as the top new mint of 2022 that wasn&rsquo;t from a new collection. The collection topped the sales charts for several weeks, even doing more in sales than Bored Apes and CryptoPunks on several occasions. A free airdrop to Azuki holders called Beanz also saw a surge in sales transactions later in 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Moonbirds,</strong> $613.4 million: Another new 2022 collection ranks among the top five collections for the year with Moonbirds. Launched in April from Proof, the collection had<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/04/26670607/what-are-moonbirds-nfts-why-are-they-crushing-bored-apemutant-ape-in-sales\"> huge initial demand </a>and saw sales volume of 50,000 <strong>Ethereum </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>) in its first day of trading. Proof has raised additional funds and<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/04/26799528/reddit-co-founder-backs-record-breaking-nft-project-second-attempt\"> counts<strong> Alexis Ohanian</strong> as an investor.</a> Moonbirds could continue to be a project to watch in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/12/30001130/exclusive-in-rare-interview-bored-ape-yacht-club-co-founder-garga-says-playing-video-games\">Exclusive: In Rare Interview, Yuga Labs Co-Founder Garga Says Playing Video Games Was The Key To Success&nbsp;</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. CloneX,</strong> $600.5 million: Launched in 2021 from <strong>RTFKT</strong>, the popular collection saw continued strength in 2022. The strength came after it was announced in December that <strong>Nike Inc </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NKE#NYSE\">NKE</a>) was <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/21/12/24584277/nike-buys-digital-sneaker-and-fashion-brand-rtfkt-what-investors-should-know\">acquiring RTFKT </a>to push forward its growth plan for Web3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. CryptoPunks, </strong>$575.2 million: One of the first NFT collections on Ethereum was CryptoPunks, launched by Larva Labs in 2017. One of the biggest news stories for NFTs was Yuga Labs <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/03/26110953/biggest-nft-news-ever-bored-ape-yacht-club-parent-yuga-labs-acquires-cryptopunks-and-larva\">announcing it was acquiring the rights </a>to CryptoPunks and Meebits from Larva Labs in March. Yuga has announced several plans for CryptoPunks going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Doodles,</strong> $391.6 million: One of the biggest collections from 2021, Doodles carried over momentum in 2022 with several <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/09/28849911/doodles-valued-at-704-million-with-funding-from-alexis-ohanian-and-ftx-heres-the-details\">funding rounds</a> that saw Ohanian invest in the project. The company also announced a new CEO coming from Billboard to lead the project and <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/06/27819816/nft-collection-doodles-adds-pharrell-to-the-board-gets-investment-from-reddit-co-founder-a\">the appointment of</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/06/27819816/nft-collection-doodles-adds-pharrell-to-the-board-gets-investment-from-reddit-co-founder-a\"> </a>Pharrell Williams</strong> as chief brand officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Sorare,</strong> $318.1 million: Sprots and entertainment NFT collection Sorare was one of the top NFT collections in 2022,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29306866/sorare-nba-nfts-and-fantasy-challenges-launch-here-are-the-details-on-scoring-contests-and\">launching digital trading cards </a>and games for both Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. The company also celebrated the 2022 World Cup with a global challenge featuring some of the top teams and competing players.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Axie Infinity,</strong> $291.1 million: Play-to-earn game Axie Infinity was one of the biggest success stories of 2021 and the top NFT on a weekly basis for many of the weeks of the year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2022, the project saw momentum fade away with play-to-earn being an area of Web3 that struggled. A new version of the game launched and several updates helped bring some momentum back to the game, but the collection saw sales of under $1.5 million in the month of November, a far cry from what the project was previously doing. Axie Infinity still ranks as the all-time leader in NFT collection sales at north of $4 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Read Next: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/12/30122512/yuga-labs-announces-activision-blizzard-gaming-veteran-as-new-ceo-what-you-need-to-know\">Yuga Labs Announces Activision Blizzard Gaming Veteran As New CEO: What You Need To Know&nbsp;</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo via Shutterstock.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n   "

This will help you understand what kind of gig will best fit your schedule.</li>\r\n\t<li>Second, list your skills and ambitions. What can you do? These don&rsquo;t need to be professional skills. In many cases, side hustles require basic abilities like driving or cleaning. Still, having a knowledge or skill that most people don&rsquo;t have can help you get more specialized in your side job.</li>\r\n\t<li>Third, what time horizon are you willing to invest to start making extra money? Side hustles can vary in nature, with some offering the opportunity to start making extra dollars in the first week, while others require a period of a few months or a year to build a business and start seeing returns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Are The Best Side Hustles To Start In 2023?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Become an active investor: If you have some money on the side,<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/active-vs-passive-investing\"> becoming an active investor</a> can be a way to improve your income and get larger returns. Investing carries financial risk, so educating oneself is key before jumping into the investor game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benzinga offers hundreds of resources for investors who want <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-start-investing-in-stocks\">to learn how to invest in different assets</a> (from stocks to real estate, bonds, NFTs and crypto), or up their game as experienced investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Handiwork and housework services:</strong> Are you good with taking care of daily household tasks? Are you the family&#39;s designated handyman?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Platforms like Taskrabbit and Handy give users the opportunity to sell their services to nearby folks in need of help around the house. Everything from furniture assembly to paintjobs, home repairs, help moving and cleaning services can be offered on the sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Freelance gigs:</strong> Many people have an extra skill that can be offered on a freelance basis. Whether you have coding knowledge, know how to design a logo or edit a video, platforms like <strong>Fiverr</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/FVRR#NYSE\">FVRR</a>) and <strong>Upwork</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/UPWK#NYSE\">UPWK</a>) allow users to create new profiles and start offering their services right away.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opportunities are limitless. They also include writing services, music composition, digital marketing, architecture work and legal consulting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Join the ridesharing economy: </strong>Riding an <strong>Uber</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/UBER#NYSE\">UBER</a>) or a <strong>Lyft</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/LYFT#NASDAQ\">LYFT</a>) has become a daily part of 21st century life. Yet many riders can forget they too can become drivers and make an extra buck on their way back from the office. If you own a car and like driving, ridesharing apps are a great alternative to invest those extra free hours at-will. These platforms have no minimum time requirements, allowing you to log in for how many rides a day you chose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Food deliveries on your bike or car:</strong> <strong>DoorDash</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DASH#NYSE\">DASH</a>), <strong>GrubHub</strong>, <strong>UberEats</strong>, and <strong>InstaCart</strong> are just some of the alternatives that you can choose from to make extra money delivering food and groceries to folks around your area. Similar to ridesharing apps, some delivery apps let you log on as much time as you need and you can do it with a bike, a scooter or by foot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Put up an extra room on Airbnb: </strong>If you have space to spare around your house, you&rsquo;re eligible to become an <strong>Airbnb</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ABNB#NASDAQ\">ABNB</a>) host. The Airbnb platform allows listings that range from shared rooms to full mansions and there&rsquo;ll always be a traveler fit to your stay. This option gives you the possibility of developing your hospitality skills and meeting new people along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Enter e-commerce: </strong>Today&rsquo;s internet offers a host of resources that make it possible to become an e-commerce owner from your garage. It&rsquo;s never been easier to build a website, develop a brand and engage an audience through platforms like <strong>Wix</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WIX#NASDAQ\">WIX</a>), <strong>Canva</strong> and <strong>Hubspot</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/HUBS#NYSE\">HUBS</a>). Whether it&rsquo;s buying wholesale products from China and selling them on <strong>Ebay</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/EBAY#NASDAQ\">EBAY</a>) <strong>Amazon</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\">AMZN</a>) or catering to a niche market, once an e-commerce site is up and running it can yield great gains with minimum time requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sell your handcrafted items online:</strong> In our over-industrialized economy, many consumers are rediscovering the value of hand-made products. Platforms like <strong>Etsy</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ETSY#NASDAQ\">ETSY</a>) allow craftsmen and craftswomen to sell their items to people around the globe. Whether it&#39;s jewelry, furniture, clothing or home decor, if you&rsquo;re crafty and love working with your hands, this might be the place for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Become an online consultant:</strong> If you&rsquo;re a professional you can do a lot more than working for a company full-time. <strong>Consultport</strong> and <strong>ProMatch</strong> are platforms that allow professionals to enlist their consulting services across industries. Lawyers, IT professionals, engineers&nbsp;and industry experts are just some of the professions that can take on extra projects in a consultant capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Teach English online: </strong>English is the most spoken second language in the world and millions are still eager to learn it. Being a native English speaker is actually a very in-demand trait and several platforms are always looking to hire new teachers. A TEFL (teaching English as a foreign language) certification is normally required. These take about 120 hours to complete, can be obtained for as little as $100 dollars and get done in less than six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo by Jenny Ueberberg on Unsplash.</em></p>\r\n"

The company fell short of the 50% long-term delivery targets it has set for itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Production for the year climbed 47.2% to 1.37 million units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commenting on the numbers, <strong>Martin Viecha, </strong>Tesla&#39;s head of investor relations, said he was super proud of the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p>~440k cars made and ~405k delivered in Q4.

After resuming production, the ramp-up was slow amid the zero-COVID policy in the country. The Giga Shanghai closed down yet again in July for factory upgrades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The country was hit with a fresh COVID wave in late 2022. Tesla, however, did not disclose any production disruption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The demand side of the equation apparently suffered, going by <a href=\"http://https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/10/29371914/tesla-slashes-china-ev-prices-by-5-to-push-up-volume-base-model-y-now-eligible-for-subsidies-but-the\">a slew of price cuts Tesla has announced since late October. </a>COVID-19 along with domestic competition has begun to weigh down on the automaker.&nbsp;Future Fund&rsquo;s <strong>Gary Black</strong>, who has delved into Tesla&rsquo;s woes multiple times recently, has said a lack of lower-priced cars in China is hurting Tesla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese EV upstarts <strong>XPeng, Inc. </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/XPEV#NYSE\">XPEV</a>), <strong>Nio, Inc. </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NIO#NYSE\">NIO</a>)&nbsp;and <strong>Li Auto, Inc.&rsquo;s </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/LI#NASDAQ\">LI</a>)&#39;s December and fourth-quarter numbers released earlier on Sunday showed that these companies prevailed despite the tough COVID-19 situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla announced price cuts in other regions as well. As recently as the past week, the company extended the $7,500 discount to buyers of its Model S/X vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&#39;s Next For TSLA: </strong> Tesla stock is coming off a tough year, having fallen about 65.47% in 2022. After bottoming at $108.24, its lowest since mid-August 2020, on Wednesday, the stock picked up slight upward momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next catalyst could be the fourth-quarter results due on Jan. 25.

        "content": "<p><strong>Bitcoin </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) experienced a tumultuous 2022, with price crashes and crypto collapses making headlines. Yet, this was also a year of immense progress for the world&#39;s largest cryptocurrency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Bitcoin <strong>Lightning Network</strong>, a critical scaling protocol enabling near-instant, low-cost payments off-chain, underwent significant growth and evolution. We take a look at the Bitcoin Lightning Network and how it changed in 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>See More:</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-crypto-day-trading-strategies\" style=\"text-decoration-line:none\"><em><strong> </strong>Best Crypto Day Trading Strategies</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/what-is-the-bitcoin-lightning-network\" style=\"text-decoration-line:none\">The Lightning Network is a revolutionary technology </a>for Bitcoin (or satoshis, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin) transactions. By increasing the capacity of the network, users benefit from faster payment speeds and larger transaction volumes, which come with lower fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since its creation in 2018, the Lighting Network has seen immense adoption beyond its critics&#39; expectations, with 4,000 BTC capacity in June and successful usage in locations such as<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/22830791\" style=\"text-decoration-line:none\"> <strong>El Salvador</strong></a>, the Isle of Man, and <strong>Gibraltar</strong>. Even Bitcoin influencer <strong>Udi Wertheimer</strong>, who had previously expressed doubts about the network&#39;s viability, has been forced to concede its &ldquo;success&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lightning Network is totally decentralized and improves Bitcoin&#39;s scalability. The publicly visible liquidity capacity rose from 1,058 Bitcoins to more than 4,771 Bitcoins in 2022. The number of Lightning Network channels increased by an impressive 80%, from 37,298 to 67,339 channels, as per 1ml.com lightning network tracker.&nbsp; Additionally, the number of public Lightning Network nodes rose by 88%, from 8,295 to 15,636 nodes (though the rate of growth slowed in the second half of the year).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New Protocol, Technologies</strong>: This year, Lightning Labs unveiled <strong>Taro</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/04/26492073/lightning-labs-attracts-70m-funding-to-facilitate-bitcoinizing-dollar-other-fiat-currencie\" style=\"text-decoration-line:none\">a protocol proposal </a>for the Bitcoin and Lightning Network to allow for the minting, sending and receiving of assets. Taro leverages the latest Bitcoin protocol upgrade, Taproot, to enable the issuance of practically any kind of asset on the Bitcoin blockchain that remains backed by the unchangeable security of Bitcoin&rsquo;s proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This opens the door for increased use cases and enhanced functionality on the network, such as the issuance of stablecoins, stocks and bonds on top of the Bitcoin protocol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Impervious Technologies </strong>unveiled the world&#39;s first Web Browser powered by Bitcoin&#39;s Lightning Network. This Peer-to-Peer Browser offers a comprehensive set of communications, data transfer&nbsp;and payment tools without any centralized intermediaries. These include end-to-end encrypted messaging, video calls, collaboration platforms, decentralized identity management, data storage&nbsp;and giving users the opportunity to monetize their data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, <strong>Value-4-Value</strong>, an innovative approach to content publishing that rewards the creator with value after their customers enjoy the content. By leveraging the Lightning Network and utilizing solutions such as Lightning Addresses and Bolt-12 invoices, over 10,000 content creators have already implemented Value-4-Value on their podcasts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rene Pickhardt,</strong> Bitcoin Lightning Network developer, told <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\"><strong>Benzinga </strong></a>that the major breakthrough for the Lightning network was in March when he developed a new approach to massively improving lightning payments reliability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pickhardt&rsquo;s research suggested that approaching the payment splitting process as an optimization problem can provide both reliability and cost-efficiency, leading to better outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Future</strong>: A new report by Arcane Research titled &ldquo;State of Lightning&rdquo; says that the Bitcoin Lightning Network could have an <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/10/23312286/bitcoin-lightning-network-will-have-700m-users-by-2030-report\" style=\"text-decoration-line:none\">astounding 700 million users by 2030.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to this report, gaming and streaming video and audio will be major use cases for the Lightning Network, with streaming services like <strong>Spotify </strong>and <strong>Netflix </strong>utilizing it for micropayments in order to offer per-minute or per-second streaming services. With that kind of usage, the Lightning Network could revolutionize the digital payments industry &mdash;&nbsp;and change the way we consume media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Price Action</strong>: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $16,842, up 0.02%, according to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\" style=\"text-decoration-line:none\">Benzinga Pro data</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Read Next:</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/12/30182429/bitcoin-ethereum-muted-dogecoin-spikes-no-signs-of-santa-claus-rally-as-analyst-says-tech-\" style=\"text-decoration-line:none\"> <em>Bitcoin, Ethereum Muted, Dogecoin Spikes: No Signs Of &#39;Santa Claus&#39; Rally As Analyst Says Tech Rout Behind Risk-Off Mood</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n   "

Analysts have been cautious this time around after much of their 2022 forecasts fell flat in the wake of the unprecedented headwinds that rocked the economy and the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Year That Was For Equity Market: </strong> The equity market peaked very early in 2022, with most stocks hitting their 52-week highs in January. Thereafter, it was the case of a broader downtrend interspersed by bear-market rallies. Even the technical <strong>Santa Claus rally </strong>that many had hoped eluded Wall Street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>See Also:</strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-depression-stocks\"><strong> </strong>Best Depression Stocks</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>S&amp;P 500 Index</strong>, considered a measure of broader market performance, ended the year down 19.44%, reversing much of the 27% advance in 2021. The year marked the worst bear market since 2008 when a recession hit in the aftermath of a housing market collapse, which later morphed into a financial crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/12/30197334/apple-down-25-meta-65-amazon-49-as-techs-hit-rough-patch-in-2022-4-factors-that-could-work-in-techs\">tech sector led the sell-off from the front,</a> as evidenced by the steeper 33.1% plunge by the <strong>Nasdaq Composite Index</strong>. The <strong>Invesco QQQ Trust </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QQQ#NASDAQ\">QQQ</a>), an exchange-traded fund that tracks non-financial tech companies, shed 32.6%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mega-cap tech stocks &mdash;&nbsp;ones having market-cap in excess of $200 billion, which are often feted as high-quality, all-weather stocks &mdash; chalked up massive losses. <strong>Tesla&nbsp;Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>), <strong>Meta Platforms&nbsp;Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\">META</a>), <strong>Nvidia Corp. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) and <strong>Amazon&nbsp;Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\">AMZN</a>) saw over 50% of their market valuation erode&nbsp;in 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Outlook Remains Muted: </strong> Uncertainty concerning the Fed rate trajectory and the economic and inflation outlook that weighed down on the equity market for much of 2022 hasn&rsquo;t been resolved yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>analyst <strong>Andrew Slimmon</strong>, however, sounded upbeat. &ldquo;The economy is proving too resilient causing the &lsquo;looming collapse&rsquo; in earnings to remain elusive for yet another quarter. I expect earnings to drip down slowly, frustrating market bears,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This along with continuing improvements on the inflation front could lead to a strong first-quarter performance, Slimmon&nbsp;added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong>, meanwhile, sees 2023 as a tale of two halves. As the market&rsquo;s focus remains on the &ldquo;higher rates for longer&rdquo; theme, equity market performance is expected to remain muted, the firm said. Against the backdrop, the firm expects sectors and regions with stable earnings, low leverage and pricing power to fare better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Once we get closer to a pivot by central banks away from tight monetary policy, we would rotate toward interest-rate sensitive sectors with a growth tilt,&rdquo; Morgan Stanley said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The visibility into the market&rsquo;s trajectory is still clouded. Here&rsquo;s a compilation of the year-end 2023 S&amp;P 500 price target by some Wall Street firms:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPMorgan: 4,200<br />\r\nFundstrat: 4,750<br />\r\nOppenheimer: 4,400<br />\r\nMorgan Stanley: 3,900<br />\r\nWells Fargo: 4,200<br />\r\nEvercore ISI: 4,150<br />\r\nUBS: 3,900<br />\r\nCantor Fitzgerald: 4,100<br />\r\nBofA: 4,000<br />\r\nRBC Capital Markets: 4,000<br />\r\nJefferies: 4,200<br />\r\nDeutsche Bank Securities: 4,500<br />\r\nBMO Capital Markets: 4,300<br />\r\nGoldman Sachs: 4,000<br />\r\nBNP Paribas: 3,400</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year-end targets range between 3,400 and 4,750, which suggests a move of a negative 11.5% to a positive 23.7%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fundstrat&rsquo;s <strong>Thomas Lee, </strong> who has the most optimistic forecast, reasoned that the 2022 crisis is now shifted to opportunities, creating the highest probabilities of over 10% returns since 2020. Inflation is falling like a rock and the Fed framework will very likely change sharply in 2023, leading to fewer hikes in 2023 and a lower terminal rate, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earnings growth is the wild card here. <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>U.S. Equity Strategist David Kostin said, &ldquo;Zero earnings growth will drive zero appreciation in the stock market.&rdquo; The firm expects S&amp;P 500 earnings to show no growth in 2023 after declining by about 17% in 2022. Revenue of the companies that are part of the index will likely rise 4%, in line with nominal GDP growth, but margins will likely shrink, eliminating growth in earnings per share, it added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HSBC</strong>, meanwhile, said it is Overweight on U.S. equities, premised on its expectations that the country will avert an outright recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Benzinga&rsquo;s Take: </strong>Corporate earnings could be lackluster at least in the first half of 2023, given the dollar strength and fears of a hard landing. Consumers, who fuel the bulk of the economic activity, could turn circumspect amid lingering recession fears, exerting further downward pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inflation, though have shown a let-up, has to demonstrate a sustainable downtrend for the Fed to relent, given its obsession with bringing down pricing pressure. With so many variables involved in turning things around, the market outlook remains highly uncertain. The only certain positive catalyst is the depressed valuation of stocks following their dismal performance in 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Read Next:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/12/30235493/brazil-asia-take-top-honors-as-best-performing-equity-markets-in-2022-here-are-the-winners-losers\">Brazil, Asia Take Top Honors As Best Performing Equity Markets In 2022: Here Are The Winners And Losers</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

This indicates that the company may be undervalued, as investors are not expressing as much interest in such companies. The most commonly used way to check for value is with the price-to-earnings multiple, or P/E. A low P/E multiple is a good indication that the stock is undervalued. </p>\n<h2>Benzinga Insights has compiled a list of value stocks in the technology sector that may be worth watching:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Valens Semiconductor</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/VLN#NYSE\">VLN</a>) - P/E: 4.47</li>\n<li><strong>Nortech Systems</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NSYS#NASDAQ\">NSYS</a>) - P/E: 4.73</li>\n<li><strong>Eltek</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ELTK#NASDAQ\">ELTK</a>) - P/E: 3.85</li>\n<li><strong>Vishay Intertechnology</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/VSH#NYSE\">VSH</a>) - P/E: 7.96</li>\n<li><strong>Ebix</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/EBIX#NASDAQ\">EBIX</a>) - P/E: 8.49</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Valens Semiconductor has reported Q3 earnings per share at $-0.02, which has increased by 75.0% compared to Q2, which was -0.08. Nortech Systems has reported Q3 earnings per share at $0.53, which has increased by 112.0% compared to Q2, which was 0.25. Eltek's earnings per share for Q3 sits at $0.17, whereas in Q2, they were at 0.13. This quarter, Vishay Intertechnology experienced an increase in earnings per share, which was $0.82 in Q2 and is now $0.93. Most recently, the company reported a dividend yield of 1.87%, which has decreased by 0.02% from last quarter's yield of 1.89%.</p>\n<p>Most recently, Ebix reported earnings per share at $0.7, whereas in Q2 earnings per share sat at $0.75. Most recently, the company reported a dividend yield of 1.57%, which has increased by 0.36% from last quarter's yield of 1.21%.</p>\n<p><strong>The Significance:</strong> A value stock may need some time to rebound from its undervalued position. The risk of investing in a value stock is that this emergence may never materialize.</p>"

Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Golden Sun Education Gr Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"short_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672750818_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Golden Sun Education Gr has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comparing Golden Sun Education Gr&#39;s Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company&#39;s peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company&#39;s peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Golden Sun Education Gr&#39;s peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 0.88%, which means the company has <strong>more</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

This paper, published online in&nbsp;Toxics, presents a preliminary framework to conduct such risk assessments, to help manufacturers and regulators without significant toxicological expertise to evaluate the health risks of inhalable cannabis concentrate additives. Ultimately, it aims to increase safety standards across the cannabis industry and, most importantly, reduce consumer risk. This proposed approach leverages New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) that avoid the use of animal testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Research limitations have created an environment where clear, actionable guidance doesn&rsquo;t exist the way we&rsquo;d like around inhalation safety. We view this paper as a starting point and look forward to continuing to build on it as research and testing capabilities evolve,&rdquo; said Echo Rufer, director of Health Sciences at PAX, Ph.D. and Diplomate American Board of Toxicology. &ldquo;We hope that manufacturers and regulators alike can leverage our framework for a data-driven, consistent approach to product formulation and policy making. We&rsquo;re excited to be partnering across industry and academia, to make this widely accessible to those who don&rsquo;t readily have access to deep toxicological expertise&mdash;in service of the greater cannabis movement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At present, 38 states and the District of Columbia permit cannabis in some capacity, for adult use or medical purposes. However, the federal status of the scheduling of cannabis and divergence across state regulations have created challenges for state-licensed cannabis manufacturers. Cannabis oil or extract products for&nbsp;vaporization&nbsp;are one of the fastest growing cannabis segments and often a starting point for new consumers. As the cannabis industry develops, regulators and cannabis manufacturers alike need actionable methods for toxicological risk assessment of inhalable cannabis concentrate additives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As researchers, scientists, and experts in this industry, it&rsquo;s our responsibility to advocate for the consumer and protect their health,&rdquo; said Shawna Vreeke, head of research &amp; toxicology at True Terpenes and PhD. &ldquo;We created and implemented this methodology to review every ingredient that goes into every True Terpenes formulation and wanted to share this research with the community. This framework serves as a first step in giving regulators and manufacturers the guidance and tools they need to assess ingredient safety rooted in scientific data. Our hope is that they will use this information to make product and policy decisions that will ensure consumer safety.&rdquo;</p>\r\n"

Some claim cannabis has myriad&nbsp;benefits, others issue myriad&nbsp;warnings. What is certain is that everyone seems to have an opinion and few&nbsp;are indifferent on the topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more and more countries around the world&nbsp;embracing&nbsp;the plant, either for medical or recreational purposes causing the&nbsp;industry to boom, a glaring&nbsp;need still persists: research.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the fact that there are more studies and information available&nbsp;these days&nbsp;on marijuana and its effects on our physical and mental health, we are so far from having it all figured out if that indeed is even a possibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A new study </strong>led by the <strong>Centre for Addiction and Mental Health</strong> (CAMH)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>published in the journal <strong>NPJ Schizophrenia</strong> provides some hope for those suffering from both schizophrenia and cannabis use disorder (CUD).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to this new research,&nbsp;<strong>repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) </strong>is related to a reduction in self-reported marijuana use by up to 60% in people with schizophrenia who have cannabis use disorder,&nbsp;<a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220303144146.htm\" style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;; color: #4a6ee0;\" target=\"_blank\">reveals Science Daily</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First things first. What is a cannabis use disorder?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although not often spoken about in this era of marijuana legalization, chronic cannabis use is known to have&nbsp;<a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/19/09/14356803/is-cbd-oil-addictive\" style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;; color: #4a6ee0;\" target=\"_blank\">caused cannabis use disorder</a>. The condition&nbsp;<strong>causes marijuana withdrawal symptoms</strong>&nbsp;that come from the development of dependency, and are often compared to those of nicotine withdrawal. Most common cannabis withdrawal symptoms include&nbsp;anxiety, poor mood, agitation and sleep problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about schizophrenia? </strong>How is this mental health disorder related to cannabis? That&rsquo;s when research is scant. A chronic illness that affects some 20 million people seems to have an interesting relationship with cannabis, but not everything is completely clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing though, CAMH clinician-scientist Dr. Tony George explains, &ldquo;People with schizophrenia have very high rates of cannabis use disorder compared to the general population, and there is strong evidence that cannabis use worsens psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in these people.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Study Highlights&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>George talked about the positive results of the new study.</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Despite the known harmful effects, there is currently no approved treatment for CUD with or without schizophrenia. These results indicate&nbsp;rTMS may be a safe and effective way to reduce cannabis among people with schizophrenia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The double-blind study,&nbsp;said to be the&nbsp;first of its kind</strong> to examine the effectiveness of rTMS in treating CUD in people with schizophrenia,&nbsp;was supported by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the CAMH Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, until relatively recently brain stimulation technologies were usually used for treatment-resistant depression. Fortunately, new studies revealed the potential of rTMS in treating drug use cravings for several substances among the general population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In this study</strong>, <strong>participants were given rTMS treatmen</strong>t at the Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention at CAMH five times a week for a month,&nbsp;targeting the part of the brain that&nbsp;controls the reward system and executive function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who were given rTMS confirmed&nbsp;<strong>cannabis use reduction of up to 60% after 28 days and also reduced cravings as&nbsp;compared to the control group that received&nbsp;fake rTMS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study&#39;s&nbsp;authors&nbsp;explained that the lack of efficient treatments for CUD in individuals with schizophrenia is because people with mental illness&nbsp;are commonly excluded from CUD clinical trials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In addition to our ability to conduct clinical trials with brain stimulation at the Temerty Centre, CAMH also has one of the largest schizophrenia outpatient clinics in North America as well as state-of-the-art addiction treatment programs,&quot; Dr. George explained. &quot;All those factors make CAMH one of the few places in the world that can lead a study like this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The study&#39;s lead author Dr.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Karolina Kozak Bidzinski</strong>, added, &ldquo;It was a difficult study to recruit []&nbsp;given the intensity of time commitment required by patients. However, the awareness patients had of the negative effects cannabis was having on their lives, the expected benefits of reducing their use, and noticing the various positive outcomes that would surface throughout the duration of the trial, enabled such a high number of patients to complete the study,&quot; Bidzinski said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hopefully this work paves the way for more research into investigating the effects of rTMS as a treatment for cannabis use disorder in people with schizophrenia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo: Courtesy of <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@natcon773?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Natasha Connell</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\r\n"

Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 0.9 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Taboola.com Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"short_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672761619_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Taboola.com has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comparing Taboola.com&#39;s Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company&#39;s peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company&#39;s peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Taboola.com&#39;s peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 5.87%, which means the company has <strong>less</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p><strong>Gossamer Bio&#39;s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOSS#NASDAQ\">GOSS</a>) short percent of float has fallen 32.89% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has <strong>14.41 million shares sold short</strong>, which is 17.59% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 3.2 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Gossamer Bio Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"short_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672761621_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Gossamer Bio has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comparing Gossamer Bio&#39;s Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company&#39;s peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company&#39;s peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Gossamer Bio&#39;s peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 3.74%, which means the company has <strong>more</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p><strong>Relmada Therapeutics&#39;s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/RLMD#NASDAQ\">RLMD</a>) short percent of float has fallen 13.6% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has <strong>1.72 million shares sold short</strong>, which is 5.78% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 1.3 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Relmada Therapeutics Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"short_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672765221_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Relmada Therapeutics has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comparing Relmada Therapeutics&#39;s Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company&#39;s peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company&#39;s peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Relmada Therapeutics&#39;s peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.33%, which means the company has <strong>more</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 3.2 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Rent the Runway Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"short_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672765223_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Rent the Runway has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comparing Rent the Runway&#39;s Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company&#39;s peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company&#39;s peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Rent the Runway&#39;s peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.79%, which means the company has <strong>more</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

Adjusting for $932.00 million in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $2.81 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company&#39;s debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Xerox Holdings&#39;s $11.42 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.33. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, but normal for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"debt_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672768831_0_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Importance of Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Together with the start of the new year, two companies have shared their latest financial decisions toward advancing their medical business programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Blackhawk&rsquo;s New Arrangement Plan For Three Of Its Businesses</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Investment holding company Blackhawk Growth Corp. has announced that its shareholders approved a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/11/29621814/psychedelics-investment-holder-blackhawk-growth-hosts-meeting-for-potential-subsidiary-spin-out\">proposed plan of arrangement</a> regarding wholly-owned subsidiary companies 1286409 B.C. Ltd (aka SpinCo), MindBio Therapeutics Pty Ltd., and Digital Media Technology Pty Ltd., by which SpinCo will become an independent psychedelics and mental health technologies company of which <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/07/28192580/this-research-collab-has-been-granted-funding-by-nz-government-for-lsd-microdosing-trials\">MindBio</a> and Digital will be wholly-owned subsidiaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the arrangement, Digital&rsquo;s shares will be transferred from Blackhawk to SpinCo and the SpinCo shares will be spun out to Blackhawk shareholders. SpinCo will become the parent company of both MindBio and Digital&nbsp;and will be renamed as &ldquo;MindBio Therapeutics Corp.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spin-out transaction will follow a statutory plan of arrangement pursuant to the BC Business Corporations Act, seeking a final order from BC&rsquo;s Supreme Court on or about Jan. 5, 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SpinCo will also apply to have its common shares listed on the CSE and to become a reporting issuer in the provinces of BC, Alberta and Ontario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides passing the arrangement resolution by nearly 99.9%, Blackhawk&rsquo;s shareholders also passed an ordinary resolution approving the stock option plan of SpinCo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This plan stipulates that the company will adopt a 20% fixed number of shares stock option plan to be reserved for issuance pursuant to the exercise of stock options, that is, a delimited number of SpinCo shares up to max. 20% of the company&rsquo;s total issued shares. The purchase of these common shares may be granted to directors, officers, employees and consultants of SpinCo or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the new provision is completed, Blackhawk shareholders will be entitled to receive one SpinCo share and one Blackhawk class A common share for each Blackhawk common share held as of the arrangement&rsquo;s record date.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Blackhawk class A shares will be listed on the CSE and, importantly, the company will continue to be a reporting issuer listed on the CSE. These new shares will have identical features and rights as the common ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Algernon Forms Private Subsidiary To Advance Psychedelic Stroke Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian clinical-stage psychedelics biotech company Algernon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (OTCQB:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AGNPF#OTCQB\">AGNPF</a>) -AKA AGN Pharma- has created Algernon NeuroScience (AGN Neuro), a new, wholly-owned private subsidiary, to advance its psychedelic DMT stroke research program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the decision, Algernon valued this specific program now entering Phase 2 clinical trial stage at $20 million and has completed an asset transfer and trademark license agreement, transferring all DMT research program assets into AGN Neuro.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also signed a management provision with the new company for all day-to-day operations as well as management of the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/09/28802272/canadian-psychedelics-company-is-ready-to-begin-the-first-global-dmt-clinical-trial-for-stroke-t\">DMT stroke clinical trial program</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;By creating AGN Neuro with the sole focus of advancing the DMT stroke research program through its future clinical trials, we are working to create an exciting new investment vehicle with the goal of enhancing shareholder value in the process,&rdquo; said AGN Pharma CEO Christopher J. Moreau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan is for AGN Neuro to remain a private company until <a href=\"http://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/10/29382239/tackling-depression-with-psychedelics-new-phase-2-clinical-study-begins-at-yale-university\">completion of a Phase 2a stroke study</a>, planned to commence sometime by the end of 2023. Based on the results, the company will eventually review and consider a potential direct IPO listing on the NASDAQ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, the new subsidiary has filed a Form 1-A offering statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking authorization to raise up to $10 million by offering up to 37.5% of its common shares (including the max. amount of bonus shares,) with majority ownership residing with AGN Pharma, under a Tier II Regulation A+ offering.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reg A+ financings are an SEC-regulated funding mechanism providing companies an alternative way to access the public markets that reduce offering costs in the process or, as stated by Moreau, &ldquo;a very successful way of raising capital by allowing the innovative online and digital marketing of securities to the general public on a global scale.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected, the total capital raised will be used for research, development and program management costs for the completion of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/11/29752223/psychedelic-therapeutics-for-human-stroke-participant-screening-expects-to-begin-soon\">Phase 1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/10/29382239/tackling-depression-with-psychedelics-new-phase-2-clinical-study-begins-at-yale-university\">Phase 2a</a> DMT stroke studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo: Benzinga edit with photo by Pexels and Shutterstock.</em></p>\r\n"

Managing director and chief investment officer at Swiss Asia Capital, <strong>Juerg Kiener</strong>, said on CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Street Signs Asia&rdquo; that he sees gold appreciating drastically this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparing the bear markets of 2001 and 2008 with the present conditions, Kiener sees similarities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In 2001, the market didn&rsquo;t just move 20 or 30%, it moved a lot, the same in 2008 when we had actually a smaller sell-off in the market and the stimulus coming back in, and gold went from $600 to $1,800 in no time, so I think we have a very good chance that we see a major move,&rdquo; Kiener said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is not going to be just 10 or 20%, I think I&rsquo;m looking at a move which will really make new highs,&rdquo; he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, <strong>Ole Hanson</strong>, also sees the current economic conditions as a bullish factor for the price of gold this year.&nbsp;&ldquo;In general, we are looking for a price friendly 2023 supported by recession and stock market valuation risks &mdash; an eventual peak in central bank rates combined with the prospect of a weaker dollar and inflation not returning to the expected sub-3% level by year-end &mdash; all adding support,&rdquo; he said, according to CNBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the&nbsp;<strong>SPDR Gold Trust</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GLD#NYSE\">GLD</a>)&nbsp;posted a return of just 0.78% in 2022,&nbsp;the year ahead may provide more upside. From a technical standpoint, gold looks headed much higher over the coming weeks and months because the commodity has been trading in a solid uptrend on larger time frames since Oct. 31.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although pullbacks should be expected if gold continues to climb higher, the bullion has also confirmed a bull market by trading above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) since Dec. 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! <a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/1ih7p9hphj9p\">Click here for a free trial</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Gold Chart:</strong> Gold is trading in a consistent uptrend on both the daily and weekly charts, but hasn&rsquo;t yet confirmed an uptrend on the monthly chart. For an uptrend to confirm on the largest of the three timeframes, the commodity will eventually need to retrace and print a higher low above $1,614.92, although it looks unlikely to decrease that much at the present time.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>On Tuesday, gold pulled back from its high-of-day price (HOD) and was looking to print a possible shooting star candlestick on the daily chart. If the commodity closes the trading session with a long upper wick, it could indicate a further pullback is in the cards for Wednesday.</li>\r\n\t<li>If gold closes the trading session near the HOD, it will print a bullish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate another rally is on the horizon. The commodity could also print an inside bar to consolidate Tuesday&rsquo;s sharp rise.</li>\r\n\t<li>On&nbsp;the daily, weekly and monthly charts, gold broke up from a descending channel on Nov. 8, which suggested a long-term reversal to the upside was likely. If the commodity continues to trade above the 200-day SMA on the daily chart for a few more weeks, the 50-day SMA will cross above the 200-day, which would indicate a long-term bull market is in the cards, possibly for much of 2023.</li>\r\n\t<li>Gold has resistance above at $1,850 and $1,877.15 and support below at $1,831.12 and $1,794.63.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>The Weekly Chart</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"gold_jan._3.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u278075/gold_jan._3.png\" style=\"height:427px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-gold-stocks\">Best Gold Stocks Right Now &bull; Updated Daily</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo: courtesy of Shutterstock.</em></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p>Shares of MercadoLibre Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MELI#NASDAQ\">MELI</a>) fell by 6.22% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let&#39;s look at how much debt MercadoLibre has.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>MercadoLibre Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on MercadoLibre&#39;s balance sheet as of November 4, 2022, long-term debt is at $2.74 billion and current debt is at $1.95 billion, amounting to $4.69 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.46 billion in cash-equivalents, the company&#39;s net debt is at $3.23 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company&#39;s debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. MercadoLibre has $11.96 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.39. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, but normal for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"debt_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672772424_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Debt Is Important</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

        "content": "<p>Shares of Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PDD#NASDAQ\">PDD</a>) rose by 33.35% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let&#39;s look at how much debt Pinduoduo has.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pinduoduo Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on Pinduoduo&#39;s balance sheet as of April 25, 2022, long-term debt is at $1.85 billion and current debt is at $9.81 billion, amounting to $11.66 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.01 billion in cash-equivalents, the company&#39;s net debt is at $10.65 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company&#39;s debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Pinduoduo has $28.44 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.41. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry, but average for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"debt_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672776020_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Investors Look At Debt?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

        "content": "<p>Not all issues are off to as a rocky start to the New Year as the S&amp;P 500 index. In fact, with a potential recession looming in 2023, one would expect the banking sector to be taking it on the chin <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/12/30240477/whats-next-for-stocks-after-s-p-500-wraps-roughest-year-since-2008\">along with the broad market</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is not the case with <strong>JPMorgan &amp; Chase Co </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/JPM#NYSE\">JPM</a>), which is battling to stay green in Monday&rsquo;s session, making it <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/joel-elconin\">the PreMarket Prep Stock of the Day</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPMorgan&#39;s Q4 Comeback:</strong> In early October, when the issue bottomed at $101.28, it was down 36% for the year and it appeared it was left for dead. At the October low, the S&amp;P 500 index was down 27%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the year it was a different story. The index, which had a formidable rally, faded into year-end, finishing in the red by nearly 20%. JPMorgan Chase has slightly retreated from its recent high and ended 2022 in the red by only by 15%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of 12:30 p.m.&nbsp;EST Tuesday, that divergence continues as the index is lower by nearly 1% and the issue is in the green by 0.41%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bullish Take:</strong> The issue is exhibiting excellent relative strength, and if the index can find support and rally, JPMorgan&nbsp;could be one of the leaders on the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The confirmation of another leg higher may come if the issue can clear a pair of monthly highs from November ($138.18) and December ($138.66).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding more significance to the $138 area&nbsp;is that the stock topped out last April at $137.41, which set the stage from the major move down to the October low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bearish Take</strong>: With JPMorgan Chase being a major component of the S&amp;P 500 index and that index breaking down, the issue should be soon to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stock hanging on to its gains is gift to shareholders who bought the dip in the fourth quarter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A stealth bear market spares many issues, and if the index intends to have another miserable year, this bank stock will eventually follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For investors&nbsp;choosing to exit the issue on weakness instead of strength, the psychological support level of $130 is important. Over the last few weeks, any retreats under that level have been bought, and JPMoran Chase&nbsp;has not closed below it since Dec.&nbsp;16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PreMarket Prep&#39;s Take:</strong> Toward&nbsp;the end of Tuesday&#39;s&nbsp;show, the author of this article noted the relative strength in the issue and questioned the reasons for it. &ldquo;This is the type of value stock that investors have been seeking out,&quot; said co-host Dennis Dick. &ldquo;It pays a dividend and has a modest price to earnings ratio.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other banks have sold off, Dick said, adding that he would sell JPMorgan if it was in his holdings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPM Price Action: </strong>Off the opening bell, the issue caught a bid with the index and rallied all the way to $136.74, which was just shy of its Dec. 13 high of ($137.09) and reversed course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has now retreated nearly $3 off that high and is trading actively around Friday&rsquo;s closing price of $134.10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The discussion on the issue from Tuesday&rsquo;s show can be found here:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ROczKZBedbM?start=3321\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.

Although the if the value of the underlying assets in BREIT has dropped significantly more than its share price, investors may want out. This could force Blackstone to sell some properties, and in the current real estate market, those properties may sell at a loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that&rsquo;s where the University of California comes in. By raising $4 billion through the investment deal with UC, Blackstone may offset some of the selling pressure and the need to maintain capital.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stephen A.

Bak called a potential shakeup in the private REIT space as being more significant to markets <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/real-estate/reit/22/12/29998401/is-a-blow-up-in-the-private-reit-space-coming-what-may-be-ahead-for-blackstones-breit\">than the FTX collapse.</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some users have taken to Twitter to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/quantian1/status/1610293889424060416\" style=\"text-decoration-line:none\">criticize</a> the UC investment in BREIT. Among the concerns is that the fund is private, and there is no easy way to determine the necessity of the deal or how badly the fund needed the cash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although UC officials have voiced confidence&nbsp;in their investment in BREIT. &quot;In the current environment, investors can benefit from stable cash-flowing investments that can grow with high global inflation. We consider BREIT to be one of the best positioned, large-scale real estate portfolios in the U.S., managed by one of the world&rsquo;s top real estate investors,&quot; <strong>Jagdeep Singh Bachher</strong>, the University of California&rsquo;s Chief Investment Officer said.</p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p><strong>Solana</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/sol/usd\">SOL</a>) was surging up about 16% at one point on Tuesday afternoon to reach over the $13 mark, as the crypto continued to rebound from its Dec. 29 low of $8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spike higher contrasted with <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) and <strong>Ethereum</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>), which were struggling to trade flat amid the bearish action of the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Dec. 29, the crypto fell under the $10 mark for the first time in almost two years, but the most recent downtrend began on Nov. 6, when information first emerged&nbsp;indicating <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried&#39;s</strong> FTX platform <a href=\"http://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/11/29586090/binance-to-dump-all-holdings-of-bankman-frieds-ftx-tokens-wont-pretend-to-make-love-after-\">was in trouble</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between that day and Nov. 9, Solana plunged over 67% before beginning to consolidate sideways above a support level at $11.26. When the crypto fell under that area on Dec. 27, technical traders may have predicted another drop was in the cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bankman-Fried had shown support for Solana, which may have spooked traders and investors, especially because Solana has seen &ldquo;fraudulent developer activity&rdquo; in the past,<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/12/30223228/solana-sol-tokens-dip-below-10-for-the-first-time-since-initial-rise\"> according to a report</a>. Solana also suffered several outages in 2022, which caused some investors to shy away from the crypto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December, Solana saw&nbsp;&quot;DeGods&quot; and &quot;Y00ts,&quot; two of the top non-fungible token (NFT) projects on the platform, announcing that they will be leaving&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/12/30205055/top-solana-nft-projects-degods-and-y00ts-leaving-sol-switching-to-these-2-blockchains\" target=\"_blank\">the SOL ecosystem</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Solana&rsquo;s recent rebound will be a relief for investors who hold the crypto at higher prices, SOL has a lot of work to do in order to prove the price action is more than a short-term bounce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! <a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/1ih7p9hphj9p\">Click here for a free trial</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Solana Chart:</strong> After Solana reached the $8 low on Dec. 29, the crypto bounced up to print a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-read-candlestick-charts\">doji candlestick</a>, which indicated a bounce was in the cards. Because short-term bounces take place within downtrends, however, there&rsquo;s currently no indication that the longer-term bottom is in.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For Solana to negate its current downtrend, the crypto will either have to shoot up above $15 or retrace to print a higher low above $8. Unless either happens over the next several days, the most likely scenario is that Solana will continue to trend lower over the next few weeks.</li>\r\n\t<li>During Tuesday&rsquo;s 24-hour trading session, Solana was attempting to break up above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) but was struggling to regain the area as support. If Solana closes the trading days under the 50-day SMA, the crypto will print a bearish shooting star candlestick, which could indicate lower prices will come on Wednesday.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bullish traders who aren&rsquo;t already in a position may choose to wait and see if Solana eventually falls lower and prints a bullish reversal candlestick above $8 to take a position.</li>\r\n\t<li>Solana has resistance above at $14.96 and $19.16 and support below at $11.26 and $8.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"sol_jan._3.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u278075/sol_jan._3.png\" style=\"height:427px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/12/30220430/10-items-on-solanas-to-do-list-for-2023\">10 Items On Solana&#39;s To-Do List for 2023</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo: courtesy of Shutterstock.</em></p>\r\n    "

The company will assess new clients&rsquo; businesses and see exactly in which ways it can help streamline operations and risk compliance. In this sense, Beacon acts almost as a consultant, coming into an outside company and revamping the company&rsquo;s technology for more efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beacon is already working with massive companies like <strong>Shell PLC</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SHEL#NYSE\">SHEL</a>) and <strong>PIMCO</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Often we are just one part of the big, complicated technology stack that these companies have. And so we sort of slot in to help people at the pointy edge of the stick, at the front office, the people that have to move quickly when the market&rsquo;s moving. We give those people the tools they need to manage their business,&rdquo; Higgins said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong>&nbsp;Beacon&rsquo;s unique approach allows&nbsp;the company to be more flexible and helps&nbsp;companies with a wide range of solutions. One of these areas, <strong>risk compliance</strong>, has been a hot term in the public debate following FTX&rsquo;s fallout.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/01/30263555/sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud-money-laundering-judge-sets-this-trial-target\">Sam Bankman-Fried Pleads Not Guilty To Fraud, Money Laundering; Judge Sets This Trial Target Date</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, Beacon helps market makers and asset managers who trade derivatives manage their risk. This is a tough job, considering derivatives often carry more risk than traditional stocks and a large umbrella of what falls under derivatives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The market opportunity is so large for the financial services industry that there is almost no point in even trying to quantify it, Higgins said. And financial companies are just spending more and more money on technology each year, which puts Beacon in a great position.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Read Next;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/01/30251964/bitboys-2023-predictions-breaking-ripple-curse-sec-chair-gary-gensler-to-resign\">BitBoy&#39;s 2023 Predictions: Breaking &#39;Ripple Curse,&#39; SEC Chair Gary Gensler To Resign?</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/027v3JQJE5s\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p>New research from consumer insights platform Veylinx suggests that abstinence events like &ldquo;Dry January&rdquo; are more than just a social media fad. More than three-quarters of Americans say they&rsquo;ve temporarily given up alcohol for at least a month in the past. Almost half of drinkers are trying to reduce their alcohol consumption right now&nbsp;and 52% of them are replacing alcohol with non-alcoholic beverages including CBD drinks. Consumers said improving their physical health and mental well-being are the main reasons for drinking less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Driven by younger consumers, the non-alcoholic beer, wine and cocktails category is surging in popularity. People trying to cut down their drinking are finding more and more alternatives on retail shelves and in bars and restaurants,&rdquo; said Anouar El Haji, CEO of Veylinx. &ldquo;Our research found that they&rsquo;re willing to pay premium prices for non-alcoholic versions of ready-to-drink cocktails. The rise of the &lsquo;sober curious&rsquo; movement gives brands countless opportunities for growth in this segment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Veylinx, which uses behavioral research to measure consumer purchasing habits, tested the fast-growing non-alcoholic canned cocktails market to learn who is buying these drinks and why. The study also measured demand for versions enhanced with functional benefits like mood boosters, detoxifiers and CBD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, people who currently drink alcohol are actually willing to pay more for non-alcoholic canned cocktails than non-drinkers. And people who say they want to reduce their alcohol intake do indeed show stronger demand for non-alcoholic cocktails.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>CBD, Mood Boosters&nbsp;And Other Variations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the canned non-alcoholic cocktails tested, CBD and mood boost versions perform best, while natural detox and zero-calorie variations lag behind. Adding CBD to a $12 four-pack of non-alcoholic canned cocktails increases demand by 13%, and adding natural mood boosters increases demand by 9%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Younger Consumers Driving the Trend</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Demographics and consumption habits impact demand: 21-35-year-olds, light drinkers and those who&#39;ve&nbsp;previously given up alcohol for a month or more show the greatest demand. Younger consumers, in particular, are the most interested in all of the non-alcoholic concepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Demand for non-alcoholic canned cocktails is 48% higher among 21-35-year-olds than people&nbsp;over 35.&nbsp;Spiking drinks with CBD boosts demand by 18% among young adults.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The mood boost version&mdash;blended with natural adaptogens and nootropics&mdash;drives the highest demand among those&nbsp;over 35s, generating 29% greater demand than the standard non-alcoholic version.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Previous participants in Dry January show 65% greater purchase interest than those who have never&nbsp;taken part.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Its latest annual report listed a number of complaints about state-level marijuana legalization, coming from police enforcement from several regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Police enforcement in states where recreational cannabis is not legal, like Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, reported that illegal trafficking groups sell marijuana and THC products mainly sourced from Colorado and the West Coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What&rsquo;s Happening With California?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Northern California HIDTA pointed to &ldquo;ancillary violence&rdquo; in connection to marijuana trafficking and &ldquo;weed&rsquo; rips,&rdquo; which seems to be on the rise following the legalization of marijuana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Human trafficking and smuggling, strong-armed robberies, home invasions, and murder was linked to the marijuana trade,&rdquo; the report says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, some legal businesses in the Golden State allegedly support criminal groups in their cannabis endeavors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Criminal groups documented in the NC HIDTA AOR have created or partnered with ostensibly legal businesses to conduct illicit production and trafficking,&rdquo; the report <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HIDTA-Annual-Report-to-Congress-2022.pdf\">continues</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to widespread violence, illegal marijuana cultivation businesses are becoming a &ldquo;serious environmental threat&rdquo; as they are &ldquo;polluting and diverting water sources and poisoning wildlife.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cannabis advocates are criticizing the report stressing that it is&nbsp;biased on the side of the&nbsp;ONDCP&#39;s&nbsp;stance on federal cannabis legalization. Although it is sadly true that&nbsp;legalization seems to be failing to curb the black market, especially in California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>High taxes, the cost of obtaining a license&nbsp;and the lack of resources devoted to enforcement action against illegal operators seem to be among the&nbsp;reasons for the struggling market in California, which recently celebrated the sixth anniversary of legalizing recreational cannabis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover,<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/22/12/29994330/6-years-post-cannabis-legalization-in-california-what-have-we-learned\"> </a>many illegal operators<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/22/12/29994330/6-years-post-cannabis-legalization-in-california-what-have-we-learned\"> get away only</a> with a slap on the&nbsp;wrist when caught, which allows them to resume operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo: Courtesy of <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@wesleygibbs?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Wesley Gibbs</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/NxRx7_mPdEk?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p>Vaping nicotine has become the most common type of substance use among young people, according to a long-term national study headed by University of Michigan researchers and reported by the Detroit News.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the past four years, nicotine vaping has surpassed alcohol and cannabis use among eighth-graders, said Richard Miech, principal investigator of the&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring the Future Study</strong>. In 2022, 7% of eighth graders vaped nicotine in the past 30 days as compared with 6% who used alcohol and 5% who used cannabis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2021, the numbers were tied&nbsp;between nicotine vaping and alcohol use among 10th graders, said Miech, but in 2022, nicotine vaping grew among that group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve seen both eighth and 10th grade where nicotine vaping beats all other forms of substance use,&quot; Miech said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vaping Spiked&nbsp;In 2018-09</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nicotine vaping was first added to the Monitoring the Future study, which&nbsp;started nearly a half-century ago,&nbsp;in 2017 and&nbsp;spiked in 2018 and 2019, the most notable increase of any substance use throughout the history of the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These were the largest increases we&#39;ve ever seen in 48 years for any substance that we&#39;ve ever tracked,&quot; Miech said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, then Michigan&#39;s Chief Medical Executive declared a public health emergency over the increase in teen&nbsp;e-cigarette use.&nbsp;Gov. Gretchen Whitmer&#39;s administration was the first in the nation to&nbsp;undertake&nbsp;to deal with the increase. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020, tobacco vaping plateaued among young people and dropped in 2021 and 2022 as did the prevalence of alcohol and cannabis use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dip occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic when students were attending school remotely, Miech said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;School is a pretty big risk factor for substance use,&quot; said Miech. &quot;That&#39;s where the older kids are who use substances and encourage the younger kids to use them and that&#39;s where you can get substances from your schoolmates.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another explanation is the vaping brand JUUL, which&nbsp;has been accused of&nbsp;marketing to children by making the flavors&nbsp;attractive to young people,&nbsp;such as bubble gum, mint&nbsp;and chocolate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The U.S. has banned such flavors in cigarettes, specifically&nbsp;because they attract children,&quot; said Miech. &quot;In 2018 and 2019, no such bans on flavors in vaping devices were in place.&nbsp;Nowadays, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is working on enforcing such a ban for vaping products, although you can walk into any gas station or drug store and see all kinds of vaping flavors remain readily available.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@sebastianradu?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Sebastian Radu on Unsplash</a></em></p>\r\n"

Employers believe that coworking spaces increase flexibility for employees to manage their work and time appropriately and create a diverse network.</p><p>However, not only for employees but also for companies, this co-working space has proven to be a practical option to save costs.</p><p><strong>Future of Cooperative Sectors in India</strong></p><p>Considering the current business climate in India, it can be concluded that they have flourished. Co-working spaces have not only helped companies thrive during the pandemic, but are sure to last well into the future. According to a recent study, it has been observed that co-working spaces currently account for 3% of the total office space. This rate is projected to increase to around 4.2% by 2023.</p><p>According to studies, it has been found that employees find these co-working spaces more productive and efficient for them. Coworking space will increase by 50 million square feet by the end of 2023. In the future, the demand for co-working spaces will increase as it increases productivity among employees which may lead to increased investment in these spaces by companies.</p><p>Co-working spaces are sought after to provide entrepreneurs with various opportunities in the process of business creation, networking and development.

This points to a 250-basis-point decrease in auto gross margins, the analyst said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the net impact could be lower, the consensus estimates for auto gross margin, excluding credits, of 27.6% for the fourth quarter are too aggressive, Sacconaghi added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The positive impact of the continuing ramp of the Berlin and Austin gigafactories will likely be mitigated by the fact that these two factories have lower margins than the company average, he said. Given the pullback in the dollar in the quarter, the analyst expects the forex impact on revenue to be a positive 50 basis points relative to the previous quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raw material costs and freight costs, according to Sacconaghi, may have declined sequentially, helping to offset price declines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significant Demand Problem: </strong>Sacconaghi is of the view that Tesla is facing significant demand problems, with the fourth-quarter book-to-bill ratio likely at less than 0.65 times despite the significant price cuts. The annualized fourth-quarter order run rate with the significant discounting was only about one million units, Sacconaghi noted. The company, meanwhile, looks to sell close to two million units in 2023 with no new models, he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the stock trading close to Bernstein&rsquo;s 2050 discounted cash flow and investor sentiment remaining horrible, the analyst isn&rsquo;t convinced about the attractiveness of the valuation. Investors are underestimating the magnitude of demand challenges the company is facing, with the potential for the 2023 and 2024 numbers to be reset, Sacconaghi said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We also worry about the potential for broader market pressure amid higher rates and slower consumer spending, which could continue to impact higher valuation stocks such as TSLA disproportionately,&rdquo; he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bernstein has an Underperform rating on Tesla shares and a $150 price target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Price Action: </strong>Tesla closed Tuesday&rsquo;s session down 12.24%, at $108.10, according to<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\"> Benzinga Pro data.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Read Next:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/23/01/30268923/elon-musk-wants-your-help-as-tesla-finally-has-way-to-get-irs-ev-qualification-norms-corrected\">Elon Musk Wants Your Help As Tesla Finally Has Way To Get IRS&#39; EV Qualification Norms Corrected</a></em></p>\r\n"

Ultimately, the&nbsp;players who bought these tokens and eggs never even got to use them since the game never went live. Additionally, it was uncovered that the game&#39;s supposed artwork, which took six months to make and involved 10 different artists, was actually just taken from Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Next</strong>: Paul denounced <strong>Eddie Ibanez </strong>as a &quot;professional conman.&quot;&nbsp;He added that neither he nor his manager, Levin, profited from the project and that they &quot;lost money trying to pick up the pieces.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NFTs&nbsp;are digital assets that are unique, indivisible, and permanently recorded on a blockchain like <strong>Ethereum </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>), <strong>Polygon </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/matic/usd\">MATIC</a>), <strong>Solana </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/sol/usd\">SOL</a>) and many more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Price Action</strong>: At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $1,250, up 2.80% in the past 24 hours, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\" style=\"text-decoration-line:none\">Benzinga Pro data.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Read Next: </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/01/30268167/bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-slip-analyst-says-this-major-crypto-needs-a-bounce-or-things-get\" style=\"text-decoration-line:none\"><em>Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Slip: Analyst Says This Major Crypto Needs A Bounce Or &#39;Things Get Painful&#39;</em></a></p>\r\n   "

        "content": "<p>If there is one tip I have been driving home in 2022 is to let the charts dictate your investing/trading decisions, not the news.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we all know, our media channels are designed to paint a grim picture. The consequences are that people are unclear about how to manage their finances which means your financial future is on the line.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;d argue that happens every year, but 2022 was a particularly tough year with the declines in the stock market. Phrases such as bear market, recession, the worst year since were freely thrown around, so I am unsurprised if 2022 had you even more bamboozled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this state of apathy to your confusion can&#39;t go on forever. At some point, you have to accept that the system will never change. It is down to you to take the bull by the horns (or the bear by the claws) and regain control over your financial future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What you don&#39;t want is to be having this same internal conversation a year from now. 2023 must be different.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why was 2022 never a bear market?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simple really. The S&amp;P 500 (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>) never broke below the weekly 200 simple moving average (w200sma).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Below I have the weekly timeframe</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot_2023-01-03_at_3.58.31_pm.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u240220/screenshot_2023-01-03_at_3.58.31_pm.png\" style=\"height:348px; width:650px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last time price broke below the w200sma was in 2008, and before that, surprise surprise, was in 2000. Both are marked with red arrows above. These were confirmed bear markets, and when ideally you wanted to be short. In reality, most would have got stung, making the classic mistake of catching falling knives. You must learn to short the market. A skill few ever gain but is immensely rewarding when a bear market does happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the S&amp;P 500 worked its way back above the w200sma in 2010, the price has since been using the w200sma as a major level of support. All marked with green arrows above.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>2011 followed by an 86% bounce&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>2016 followed by a 61% bounce</li>\r\n\t<li>2019 followed by 106% bounce (creating the current all-time high)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the strong bull run post-CV19, it is not surprising we have seen such an aggressive correction this year. Contrary to what has been spewed all over the internet, these corrections are healthy for the market. You just have to learn how to deal with them in a cool, calm and collected manner.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(We can ignore the blue arrow above. That is the 35% drop in price caused by CV19. Black swan events almost always have a violent short-term impact before they are absorbed back into the market.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This brings us to the orange arrow above, where the S&amp;P 500 bounced off the w200sma in October. A 14% bounce followed this to the high of November, but the price is currently around 6% away from the w200sma.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The price is in a very interesting position which takes us onto 2023...</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the S&amp;P 500 works its way below the w200sma, we will likely see a repeat of 2000 and 2008. That is when we will be in a bear market officially and when we short.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the S&amp;P 500 holds firm, we could see the next leg up and a revival of the bull market in play since 2009 and when we buy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, we are in this grey area where we stand aside, apply patience, protect capital and wait for the market to dictate a direction. We can react accordingly, either long or short.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>But Zaheer, what about all those tech stocks that tanked in 2022?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tech is one sector. At the start of this year, we saw a rotation of money from tech into healthcare.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Regular readers will know I like stocks that are in trend and printing new all-time highs. They move the fastest. I typically hold for 12 to 24 months before moving to the next set of stocks.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2022, whilst stocks like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) and PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PYPL#NASDAQ\">PYPL</a>) were down 70%+, McKesson Corp (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MCK#NYSE\">MCK</a>) was up 50%+, a stock I have highlighted numerous times in 2022. Arch Capital Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ACGL#NASDAQ\">ACGL</a>), a consumer discretionary stock, was up 50% since October. Financials is also looking interesting, with stocks like W R Berkley Corp (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WRB#NYSE\">WRB</a>) looking strong. It moved up 27% in 2022. These stocks are all potentially set to continue their climb in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Below is the monthly timeframe for MCK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot_2023-01-03_at_3.59.08_pm.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u240220/screenshot_2023-01-03_at_3.59.08_pm.png\" style=\"height:348px; width:650px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your job as an investor is to know when to let go of stocks that are turning, and replace them with the next set of strong stocks from the strongest sectors. This forms the foundation of portfolio management.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are unsure how to do that, maybe that is where your priority lies at the start of 2023...&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My advice, block out the noise and ensure you position yourself to profit regardless of which direction the market goes. Regret is not an option.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I bid you all a progressive, productive and profitable 2023. Out with the old and in with the new!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Featured image&nbsp;sourced from <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/bull-bear-on-financial-newspaper-3d-1424708993\">Shutterstock</a></em></p>\r\n "

BDSA predicts New York will be the largest new market for legal cannabis in 2023. <strong>Consumer </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>nsights</strong> data reveal strong growth within the state, with 45% of those surveyed claiming to be past six-month consumers, an approximate 17% increase in consumer penetration since fall 2021. An additional 27% of New York adults indicate they&rsquo;re likely to consume in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With nearly 15 million residents over the age of 21 and tens of millions more tourists visiting the state annually, New York is one of the most exciting cannabis opportunities in 2023,&rdquo; stated <strong>Roy Bingham</strong>, co-founder and CEO of BDSA. &ldquo;Despite some expected growing pains in the early years, the market is expected to be the second largest contributor to sales growth through 2026, following Florida.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When looking at category shares in the early months of New York&rsquo;s adult-use market, flower sales are expected to hold a high share of unit and dollar sales for at least the first few months. Recent New York medical sales indicate that the vape category in New York&rsquo;s adult-use market may account for a larger share of sales than in other newly minted adult-use markets. In November, the vape and flower categories each accounted for 35% of medical cannabis sales in New York. In contrast, the vape category only accounted for 27% of adult-use sales in the first three months of New Jersey&rsquo;s adult-use market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BDSA Consumer Insights show that New Yorkers have a propensity for flower-based products and are 35% more likely than the aggregate of consumers in adult-use states to prefer joints they have rolled themselves. They are also 27% more likely to prefer &ldquo;spliffs&rdquo; (a joint containing tobacco that consumers must roll themselves).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Packaging is also important to New York consumers, who are significantly more likely to purchase a product based on visually appealing packaging, discreet packaging, resealable or reusable packaging, and high-quality, premium packaging relative to consumers in other adult-use states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BDSA&rsquo;s Retail Sales Tracking now tracks market performance by state, category, brand, product and attributes across 14 U.S. markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Get your daily dose of <a href=\"http://www.benzinga.com/cannabis\" target=\"_blank\">cannabis news</a></em> <em>on Benzinga Cannabis.

        "content": "<p>Shares of DXC Technology Inc. (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DXC#NYSE\">DXC</a>) rose by 3.32% in the past three months. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials. One key aspect of a companies financials is its debt, but before we understand the importance of debt, let&#39;s look at how much debt DXC Technology has.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DXC Technology Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on DXC Technology&#39;s balance sheet as of November 4, 2022, long-term debt is at $3.69 billion and current debt is at $834.00 million, amounting to $4.53 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $2.26 billion in cash-equivalents, the company&#39;s net debt is at $2.27 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company&#39;s debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. DXC Technology has $17.74 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.26. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, but average for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"debt_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672840820_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Importance of Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios? Check out Benzinga Pro, a market research platform which provides investors with near-instantaneous access to dozens of stock metrics - including debt-to-equity ratio. <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Click here to learn more</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p><a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/?utm_source=insights\">According to Benzinga Pro data</a> <strong>SMART Global Holdings</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SGH#NASDAQ\">SGH</a>) posted a 73.94% decrease in earnings from Q4. Sales, however, increased by 6.35% over the previous quarter to $465.48 million. Despite the increase in sales this quarter, the decrease in earnings may suggest SMART Global Holdings is not utilizing their capital as effectively as possible. SMART Global Holdings reached earnings of $20.43 million and sales of $437.70 million in Q4. </p>\n<h3>What Is Return On Capital Employed?</h3>\n<p>Earnings data without context is not clear and can be difficult to base trading decisions on. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) helps to filter signal from noise by measuring yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. <strong>In Q1, SMART Global Holdings posted an ROCE of 0.01%.</strong></p>\n<p>It is important to keep in mind that ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but does not account for factors that could affect earnings and sales in the near future. </p>\n<p>ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows SMART Global Holdings is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. </p>\n<p>For SMART Global Holdings, the positive return on capital employed ratio of 0.01% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively.  Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns.</p>\n<h3>Upcoming Earnings Estimate</h3>\n<p>SMART Global Holdings reported Q1 earnings per share at $0.79/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.57/share.</p>\n<p>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</p>"

        "content": "<p>With the new year now underway, analysts and stock market experts are sizing up what could happen in 2023. Here are some predictions from <strong>Loup Ventures</strong> and its Managing Partner <strong>Gene Munster.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The <strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 Global ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>) had its <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/12/30240477/whats-next-for-stocks-after-s-p-500-wraps-roughest-year-since-2008\">worst performance since 2008 in 2022, down over 19%.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The down year for the S&amp;P 500 and many sectors could make it hard to predict what&rsquo;s ahead for stocks in 2023. Munster shared his annual predictions for the year ahead, with a focus mainly on the technology sector. For more on Munster&rsquo;s 2023 thoughts, check out his interview with Benzinga <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua6bqNyFy4Y\">on PreMarketPrep below</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Munster&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://loupfunds.com/loups-2023-predictions/\">Predictions</a>:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. The FAANG stocks will outperform the S&amp;P 500 in 2023: </strong>FAANG is one of the most commonly used stock acronyms and covers the companies of <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\">META</a>), <strong>Apple Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>), <strong>Amazon.com Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\">AMZN</a>), <strong>Netflix Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NFLX#NASDAQ\">NFLX</a>) and <strong>Alphabet Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ\">GOOG</a>)(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ\">GOOGL</a>). These stocks were down 48% in 2022, turning in a worse performance than the S&amp;P 500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The reason why we are optimistic on FAANG is that these companies continue to operate high-quality, generational business. In 2022, most FAANG names have not experienced an impairment to their core business,&rdquo; Munster said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Related Link:<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/topics/22/12/30205498/gene-munster-tells-benzinga-where-he-thinks-tech-will-go-in-2023\"> Gene Munster Tells Benzinga Where He Thinks Tech Will Go In 2023&nbsp;</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Apple will unveil mixed reality headset in late 2023:</strong> A repeat of a 2022 prediction by Munster, the managing partner thinks 2023 will be the year that Apple unveils its new headset. Munster thinks sales could start in 2024 for the device, with a $3,000 price target and an initial target market of developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Tesla delay announcement of Model 2:</strong> One of the big catalysts many are calling for with electric vehicle giant<strong> Tesla Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) is a more affordable vehicle. Munster thinks Tesla will delay the announcement of the Model 2 until 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If the company announces the lower priced car too early, they risk slowing sales of Model 3, while ramping capacity during what is likely to be a broader auto recession,&rdquo; Munster said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Munster said it is more likely that a preview of the Model 2 happens in 2024 with the product releasing in 2025.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. F-150 Lightning will outsell Cybertruck</strong>: The highly anticipated electric pickup truck from Tesla is expected to launch in 2023 and could have over 80,000 deliveries. While the total is high, Munster sees&nbsp;<strong>Ford Motor Company </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/F#NYSE\">F</a>) having over 100,000 deliveries of its electric pickup truck in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In 2024, however, we look for the tables to turn when Cybertruck production is fully ramped,&rdquo; Munster said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cybertruck has <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/11/29844801/most-anticipated-vehicle-launch-ever-heres-how-many-tesla-cybertrucks-are-reserved-report\">reservations listed as high</a> as 1.5 million units by some estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Electric vehicles sales could disappoint:</strong> One prediction by Munster is that 2023 could be a disappointing year for electric vehicles as a result of the overall car market being hit. In 2022, electric vehicles made up around 6% of all new car sales.

        "summary": "Shares of IDEXX Laboratories Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX) moved higher by 28.56% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let&#39;s look at how much debt IDEXX Laboratories has.",
        "content": "<p>Shares of IDEXX Laboratories Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/IDXX#NASDAQ\">IDXX</a>) moved higher by 28.56% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let&#39;s look at how much debt IDEXX Laboratories has.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>IDEXX Laboratories Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on IDEXX Laboratories&#39;s financial statement as of November 1, 2022, long-term debt is at $760.81 million and current debt is at $633.00 million, amounting to $1.39 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $99.18 million in cash-equivalents, the company&#39;s net debt is at $1.29 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company&#39;s debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. IDEXX Laboratories has $2.64 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.53. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, but normal for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"debt_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672844423_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Importance of Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

        "content": "<p><strong>Prometheus Biosciences&#39;s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/RXDX#NASDAQ\">RXDX</a>) short percent of float has fallen 35.76% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has <strong>3.43 million shares sold short</strong>, which is 8.3% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 4.0 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prometheus Biosciences Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"short_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672844426_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Prometheus Biosciences has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comparing Prometheus Biosciences&#39;s Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company&#39;s peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company&#39;s peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Prometheus Biosciences&#39;s peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 7.59%, which means the company has <strong>more</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

I said yes, and through another person, they became the godfathers of this project.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently,<strong> </strong>operatives and producers working for &quot;Los Chapitos&quot; are in the process of creating a new strain and launching a brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are buying seeds from all over the world to create our own strain, to produce top-notch Sinaloa weed and to develop a strong brand even better than the gringos,&quot; the producer continued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, they are also pushing for the legalization of cannabis in Mexico (Cannabis has been <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/06/21756779/mexico-supreme-court-decriminalizes-marijuana-for-adult-use\">decriminalized</a> in Mexico, but Congress has yet to pass a full legalization law to establish the legal guidelines to grow, sell, and possess for all adults).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The juniors are not only investing in producing and branding weed,&quot; the operative said. &quot;They are also investing in lobbying with Mexico&#39;s top politicians to legalize weed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Sinaloa Cartel commander, a connection between Los Chapitos and Culiac&aacute;n&#39;s cannabis producers, says the <strong>&quot;Los Chapitos&quot; want to run a legal cannabis business.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The juniors are a different litter. They are educated. They want to live well and stop being a target for the government,&quot; he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sinaloa-cartel-aiming-to-corner-marijuana-market-in-mexico-2022-12\">said</a>. &quot;So weed could be their option to go out of the illegal [trade] and become successful businessmen in Mexico and leave all the crime behind.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mexico&#39;s Marijuana Legalization Efforts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, cannabis has been prohibited in Mexico for decades. In 2018, Mexico&#39;s Supreme Court struck down the prohibition, at least as it applies to personal use. The ruling was<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/11/24196595/when-is-mexico-voting-on-cannabis-legalization\"> general </a>and did not specifically create a framework for legalization involving possession and cultivation limits or a regulated industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020 the Senate<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/20/11/18447925/regulatory-update-mexico-senate-approves-bill-madison-passes-new-cannabis-rules-nj-amends-licens\"> greenlighted a measure</a> legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. That bill sought to set up a regulated cannabis market that will enable people 18 years and older to buy and own up to 28 grams of cannabis legally. Shortly after, the Chamber of Deputies amended it and passed it in 2021, sending it back to the originating chamber. Once Senate lawmakers took up the amended measure, some of the leaders pointed out that the proposal was unworkable, <a href=\"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/mexican-senators-seek-yet-another-extension-of-marijuana-legalization-deadline/\">reported</a> Marijuana Moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this year, former Mexican president <strong>Vicente Fox</strong> once again <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/09/29058702/ex-mexico-president-pushes-for-marijuana-legalization-d-c-voters-against-crackdown-on-cannabis-g\">called </a>for the legalization and regulation of recreational cannabis. Fox, who partially owns chain stores selling CBD products, stressed that legalization would curtail drug cartel activity by creating opportunities for ordinary Mexicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About a decade ago, Mexico<strong> </strong>was smuggling a significant amount of marijuana for the U.S. illegal market,<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/04/26799508/tft-marijuana-trafficking-is-changing-at-us-mexico-border-heres-how\"> according</a> to the DEA. But as more states continue to legalize cannabis in the U.S., Mexico is now seeing an uptick in American-made pot entering its side of the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo: Courtesy of <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@garciasaldana_?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Pablo Garc&iacute;a Salda&ntilde;a</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/mexico-cannabis?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\r\n"

In Stanphyl&rsquo;s December letter to investors, Spiegel discussed his bearish take on Tesla and revealed just how much his Tesla short position impacted Stanphyl&rsquo;s full-year returns in 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/12/30219389/is-elon-musk-really-done-selling-tesla-stock-he-has-said-so-4-times-in-the-past-year\">Is Elon Musk Really Done Selling Tesla Stock? He Has Said So 4 Times In The Past Year</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the letter, Spiegel said he still considers Tesla grossly overvalued and is maintaining short positions in both Tesla and the <strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>) heading into 2023. Spiegel also admitted he pulled the plug&nbsp;too early when he exited his short position in the <strong>ARK Innovation ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ARKK#NYSE\">ARKK</a>) earlier in 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Tesla&rsquo;s inevitable meltdown (alright, so I was a mere eight years too early!) was a big contributor to this year&rsquo;s performance (and we remain short it, as I believe it has another 90% to go), as were our other short positions in the S&amp;P 500 (via SPY) and, early in the year, the garbage-stock ETF ARKK (which I covered way too early, leaving lots of additional profit on the table),&rdquo; Spiegel said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While his short position in Tesla paid off big in 2022, Cathie Wood&rsquo;s ARKK ETF also finished the year down 67%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/22/12/30240328/huge-rebound-for-tesla-lucid-bankruptcy-auto-analysts-10-bold-predictions-for-2023\">Huge Rebound For Tesla?

Heading into 2023, Spiegel joked that his chances of repeating such an impressive performance this year are &quot;roughly equal to the chance of <a href=\" https://www.benzinga.com/topic/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a> offering me a board seat at Tesla.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Benzinga&rsquo;s Take:</strong> Spiegel has taken a lot of criticism over the years for his bearish take on Tesla, which had certainly been costly prior to 2022. However, Stanphyl also reported a 25.9% gain in 2021 even with Tesla shares up 49.7% on the year, highlighting Spiegel&#39;s ability to effectively manage risk in his short positions as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Now Read:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/01/30270634/tesla-analyst-warns-brutal-pain-will-continue-in-2023-unless-elon-musk-does-this\">Tesla Analyst Warns &#39;Brutal Pain&#39; Will Continue In 2023 Unless Elon Musk Does This</a></em></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p><strong>Snowflake&#39;s</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SNOW#NYSE\">SNOW</a>) short percent of float has risen 14.02% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has <strong>13.09 million shares sold short</strong>, which is 4.23% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 2.2 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Snowflake Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"short_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672844429_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Snowflake has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comparing Snowflake&#39;s Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company&#39;s peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company&#39;s peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Snowflake&#39;s peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 6.54%, which means the company has <strong>less</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p><strong>CarMax's</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/KMX#NYSE\">KMX</a>) short percent of float has risen 5.94% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has <strong>18.48 million shares sold short</strong>, which is 13.19% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 6.1 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\r\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\r\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\r\n<h3>CarMax Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672848023_0.png\" alt=\"short_fig\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for CarMax has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.</p>\r\n<h3>Comparing CarMax's Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\r\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, CarMax's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 17.96%, which means the company has <strong>less</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\r\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a>.</p>\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>"

        "summary": "Shares of Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) fell by 61.22% in the past three months. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials.",
        "content": "<p>Shares of Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/OPEN#NASDAQ\">OPEN</a>) fell by 61.22% in the past three months. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials. One key aspect of a companies financials is its debt, but before we understand the importance of debt, let&#39;s look at how much debt Opendoor Technologies has.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Opendoor Technologies Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Opendoor Technologies&#39;s most recent financial statement as reported on November 3, 2022, total debt is at $8.04 billion, with $4.66 billion in long-term debt and $3.39 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $1.33 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $6.71 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company&#39;s debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Opendoor Technologies&#39;s $9.78 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.82. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry, but average for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"debt_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672848026_0_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Importance of Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

        "content": "<p><strong>Apollo Endosurgery&#39;s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/APEN#NASDAQ\">APEN</a>) short percent of float has fallen 63.08% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has <strong>425 thousand shares sold short</strong>, which is 1.2% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 0.6 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Apollo Endosurgery Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"short_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672848026_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Apollo Endosurgery has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comparing Apollo Endosurgery&#39;s Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company&#39;s peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company&#39;s peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Apollo Endosurgery&#39;s peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 5.92%, which means the company has <strong>less</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p>Shares of AstraZeneca Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AZN#NASDAQ\">AZN</a>) moved higher by 28.78% in the past three months. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials. One key aspect of a companies financials is its debt, but before we understand the importance of debt, let&#39;s look at how much debt AstraZeneca has.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>AstraZeneca Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the AstraZeneca&#39;s most recent balance sheet as reported on March 7, 2017, total debt is at $16.81 billion, with $14.50 billion in long-term debt and $2.31 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $5.02 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $11.79 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company&#39;s debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. AstraZeneca has $62.53 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.27. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, but normal for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"debt_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672851626_0_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Importance of Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

If that happens, Amazon will have negated the current downtrend with a formation of a higher low.</li>\r\n\t<li>The slightly lower prices on Wednesday were formed on lower-than-average volume, which may indicate the stock is running out of sellers. If Amazon fails to break up above Tuesday&rsquo;s high-of-day on Thursday, the stock may continue to trade sideways on decreasing volume for a period of time.</li>\r\n\t<li>If the selling pressure on Amazon increases and the stock closes the trading day near its low-of-day price, Amazon will print a bearish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate the downtrend will continue and the stock will fall to a fresh low.</li>\r\n\t<li>Amazon has resistance above at $86.75 and $89.03 and support below at $84.25 and the psychologically important $80 mark.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot_2048.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u278075/screenshot_2048.png\" style=\"height:427px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/01/30274826/why-is-riptwitch-trending-on-twitter-everything-you-need-to-know\">Why Is #RipTwitch Trending on Twitter?

Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 1.8 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Farfetch Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"short_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672851626_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Farfetch has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comparing Farfetch&#39;s Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company&#39;s peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company&#39;s peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Farfetch&#39;s peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 10.79%, which means the company has <strong>less</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p><strong>OceanPal&#39;s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/OP#NASDAQ\">OP</a>) short percent of float has risen 138.04% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has <strong>130 thousand shares sold short</strong>, which is 4.38% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 0.5 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/\">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/short-interest\"><strong>List of the most shorted stocks</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>OceanPal Short Interest Graph (3 Months)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"short_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672851628_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for OceanPal has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comparing OceanPal&#39;s Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company&#39;s peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company&#39;s peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>, OceanPal&#39;s peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 5.47%, which means the company has <strong>less</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be <strong>bullish</strong> for a stock? <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-make-money-on-a-short-squeeze/\"><strong>This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

        "content": "<p>Shares of Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ILMN#NASDAQ\">ILMN</a>) moved higher by 1.43% in the past three months. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials. One key aspect of a companies financials is its debt, but before we understand the importance of debt, let&#39;s look at how much debt Illumina has.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Illumina Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on Illumina&#39;s financial statement as of November 4, 2022, long-term debt is at $495.00 million and current debt is at $1.25 billion, amounting to $1.74 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.00 billion in cash-equivalents, the company&#39;s net debt is at $741.00 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company&#39;s debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Illumina&#39;s $11.26 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.15. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, but normal for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"debt_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672855221_0_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Importance of Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios? Check out Benzinga Pro, a market research platform which provides investors with near-instantaneous access to dozens of stock metrics - including debt-to-equity ratio. <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Click here to learn more</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga&#39;s automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</em></p>\r\n"

Now I&rsquo;m hoping kids have somewhere to go now where they can take their passion. This is going to change the lives of a lot of kids and hopefully, it&rsquo;s more than just fun and games.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Matthew Moreno</strong>, a sophomore at the center of learning, reflected on the social role of this new program and told WSVN: &ldquo;I think that it levels the playing field. People will see the jocks and the nerds, you will see a lot of gamers in schools feel very excluded in micro-social spaces and now that it&rsquo;s becoming more inclusive, it also grants them a ton of opportunities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent times, esports have&nbsp;been in everyone&rsquo;s mouths and minds: the esports industry, projected to reach $5.75 billion in sales by 2030, also draws in multi-million-people audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>See also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/01/30261081/2023-will-be-a-big-year-for-videogames-says-konami-producer-are-star-wars-and-metal-gear-so\">2023 Will Be A Big Year For Videogames, Says Konami Producer: Are &#39;Star Wars&#39; And &#39;Metal Gear Solid 3&#39; In The Works?

Pfizer is approaching loss of exclusivity on drugs representing about $17 billion in sales from 2025 through 2030. Pfizer has guided for drug launches worth a collective $20 billion in new revenue by 2030, but Meacham said additional upside for the stock would&nbsp;likely be driven largely by product launches that occur in 2024 and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Benzinga&#39;s Take:</strong> Pfizer and Merck are two of the biggest and best <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/top-10-blue-chip-stocks/\">blue chip</a> investments in the defensive health care sector, and both companies will likely make excellent long-term investments at current levels.

At the same time, marijuana use has been increasing among adults, especially in states where it is legal. So, is there a connection between the two? The study authors seem to think so. They concluded that asthma prevalence increased in states where cannabis was legalized for recreational use in recent years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to recent statistics, marijuana was used by 11.9% of parents with minor children in legal recreational marijuana&nbsp;states, followed by states with medical marijuana programs&nbsp;and the lowest (6.1%) in states without legal marijuana laws. As cannabis&nbsp;legalization and popularization grow,&nbsp;so does exposure to secondhand smoke, which can lead to pediatric asthma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study revealed that the overall prevalence of asthma in the pediatric population was no longer dropping in recent years (relative to 2016-17). Furthermore, the study discovered no significant difference in asthma prevalence between states with legal medical marijuana and recreational programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of children with asthma aged 12 to 17 grew in states with legal adult-use cannabis markets, compared to states that have not legalized marijuana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, previous research has shown that certain cannabinoids found&nbsp;in cannabis such as&nbsp;THC, may act as a bronchodilator, reducing respiratory obstruction and increasing airflow to the lungs.

The Fed reiterated its previous intentions to do whatever it takes to bring inflation down, but said it may continue to soften its tightening measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weakening of the Committee&rsquo;s resolve to achieve its price-stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path,&rdquo; the Fed said in its minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/12/30240477/whats-next-for-stocks-after-s-p-500-wraps-roughest-year-since-2008\">What&#39;s Next For Stocks After S&amp;P 500 Wraps Roughest Year Since 2008?</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fed also discussed the risks associated with a pivot from tightening to loosening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Participants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time,&quot; the Fed said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, FOMC members said &quot;historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/22/12/30237361/stock-strategist-lists-5-reasons-to-stick-with-value-in-2023\">Stock Strategist Lists 5 Reasons To &#39;Stick With Value&#39; In 2023</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why It&rsquo;s Important:</strong> The minutes come after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.5% in December, following four 0.75% interest rate hikes in five months.

Republican <strong>Matt Gaetz</strong>, however, stood up to nominate Jordan instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Wednesday, there was a shift: Texas Rep. <strong>Chip Roy</strong> &mdash; one of the 20 who voted for Jordan and against McCarthy on Jan. 3 &mdash; chose to nominate Rep. <strong>Byron Donalds</strong> (pictured below) of Southwestern Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u176590/byron_donalds.jpg\" style=\"height:550px; width:440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nineteen other representatives, including Rep. <strong>Lauren Boebert</strong> of Colorado, voted for Donalds in the fourth round (Boebert even suggested that former U.S. President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> should switch support from McCarthy to Donalds).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donalds also received 20 votes in the fifth round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Democrats remained unanimous in their support for Jeffries, a representative of New York&#39;s 8th congressional district. Still, they are reportedly frustrated for being unable to carry out constituent services and appoint committee members due to the Republican stalemate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s worth noting the speaker does not need to be a member of Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the first time in a century that it has taken more than one ballot to elect a speaker.

Piedmont Lithium is one of the few companies in the world that has the ability to process spodumene ore into lithium hydroxide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This agreement would&nbsp;enable Tesla to have a reliable source of the mineral, which is essential for the production of the company&rsquo;s electric cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The agreement was seen as a major milestone for Tesla, as it gave the company a secure source of supply for its lithium needs. The deal also served&nbsp;to strengthen the company&rsquo;s partnerships with other suppliers in the industry and could lead to even more agreements in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the agreement could prove beneficial for both companies. For Tesla, it would provide the company with a reliable source of lithium, while for Piedmont Lithium, it would open up new opportunities for growth and expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/g/bruev\"><em>Grisha Bruev</em></a><em>&nbsp;via Shutterstock</em></p>\r\n "

        "content": "<p>Over the past three months, shares of FirstEnergy Inc. (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/FE#NYSE\">FE</a>) moved higher by 14.81%. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials. One key aspect of a companies financials is its debt, but before we understand the importance of debt, let&#39;s look at how much debt FirstEnergy has.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>FirstEnergy Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the FirstEnergy&#39;s most recent balance sheet as reported on October 25, 2022, total debt is at $21.51 billion, with $20.91 billion in long-term debt and $608.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $251.00 million in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $21.26 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company&#39;s debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. FirstEnergy has $44.85 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.48. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, but normal for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"debt_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672858825_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Debt Is Important</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Before having a look at the importance of debt, let&#39;s look at how much debt Creatd has.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Creatd Debt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Creatd&#39;s most recent financial statement as reported on November 16, 2022, total debt is at $7.85 million, with $28 thousand in long-term debt and $7.82 million in current debt. Adjusting for $439 thousand in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $7.41 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company&#39;s debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Creatd&#39;s $8.72 million in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.9. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, but average for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"debt_fig\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1672862419_0.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Debt Is Important</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

        "content": "<p>Cantor Fitzgerald&#39;s Pablo Zuanic says&nbsp;the U.S. cannabis industry has great value but is in a tight and defined investable pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&#39;s hope:&nbsp;&ldquo;We are confident about the regulatory tailwinds pushing the U.S. marijuana industry forward, taking a long-term view,&rdquo;<strong> </strong>said Zuanic, however&nbsp;&ldquo;in the near term, operators face macro pressures, limited funding opportunities, and runaway licensing in some states.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SAFE Banking Act&rsquo;s failure to materialize:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zuanic said that without&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/safe-banking-act\">SAFE Banking Act</a> and a divided Congress, he is even more confident &quot;of the durability, scalability, and long-term outlook of the larger and better-capitalized U.S. MSOs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/12/30082247/safe-cant-wait-minority-owned-cannabis-start-ups-need-banking-reform\">smaller operators</a> could be excluded and&nbsp;&ldquo;in some cases, new licensees may not even be able to raise capital to start operations,&rdquo;&nbsp;Zuanic said in a recent note. &ldquo;Still, the question of &#39;investability&#39;&nbsp;(we do not mean fundamentals) remains a concern, with at best a TSX listing (and increased U.S. custody services?) helping in the next 12 months. Increasingly, we believe a rescheduling scenario by 3Q24 (not before) is becoming more likely, but that may delay/entangle other reform efforts in the interim.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Top Catalysts For Building Momentum</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Zuanic believes that&nbsp;the following catalysts will create headlines over the next one to two&nbsp;years:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Revisions to the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/20/12/18658947/hemp-update-transition-from-2014-farm-bill-to-2018-farm-bill\">Farm Bill</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Passage of The&nbsp;Hemp and Hemp-Derived CBD Consumer Protection and Market Stabilization Act of 2021 (<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/841\">HR 841</a>).</li>\r\n\t<li>U.S. MJ companies listed on the TSX</li>\r\n\t<li>U.S. companies acquiring Canadian assets</li>\r\n\t<li>Attempts to amend the<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280E\"> IRS&rsquo;s 280E Code</a></li>\r\n\t<li>U.S. exchanges listing U.S. plant-touching companies</li>\r\n\t<li>White House <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/12/30126063/bipartisan-lawmakers-urge-biden-to-act-on-cannabis-scheduling-which-is-arcane-and-out-of-touch\">re-scheduling cannabis</a> (or de-scheduling)</li>\r\n\t<li>Attempts to reintroduce (and pass) SAFE</li>\r\n\t<li>Comprehensive reform</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Will&nbsp;The Pie Be Divided?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Noting that the&nbsp;industry made significant progress in 2022,&nbsp;Zuanic named&nbsp;some of the companies that will likely&nbsp;take a piece of the market in the future. &ldquo;20 years from now, the global legal cannabis industry could be worth $200Bn. How does the pie split? Like the tobacco/liquor/beer industries (consolidated) or the wine industry (fragmented)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A company with a 25% global wholesale share could generate $25Bn in sales by then ($200Bn x 0.50 markup x 25% share). If we assume 25% EBITDA margins and a 30x multiple (for a growing industry with high margins), then on an EBITDA valuation, such a company could be worth $190Bn. No company comes close to that,&quot; he said. &quot;The two largest market cap MSOs are Curaleaf (OTCQX:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CURLF#OTCQX\">CURLF</a>) ($2.9Bn) and Green Thumb (OTCQX:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GTBIF#OTCQX\">GTBIF</a>) ($2Bn); only four other cannabis companies have market caps over $1Bn; among MSOs, Trulieve (OTCQX:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TCNNF#OTCQX\">TCNNF</a>) and Verano Holdings (CSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/VRNO#CSE\">VRNO</a>) (OTCQX:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/VRNOF#OTCQX\">VRNOF</a>); among Canada LPs, Tilray (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TLRY#NASDAQ\">TLRY</a>) and Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CGC#NASDAQ\">CGC</a>).&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Get your daily dose of&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"http://www.benzinga.com/cannabis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">cannabis news</a></em><em>&nbsp;on Benzinga Cannabis.

Inventor <strong>Thomas Edison</strong> demonstrated his first working phonograph model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pound of rice cost about 9 cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Legacy:</strong>&nbsp;Vanderbilt was born on May 27, 1794, on Staten Island, New York. Vanderbilt&#39;s legendary business career reportedly started at age 11 when he dropped out of school to help his father ferry cargo and passengers between Staten Island and Manhattan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By age 18, Vanderbilt was contracted by the U.S. government to use his ferry business to supply military outposts during the War of 1812. It was during this period that he earned his famous nickname &quot;The Commodore.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vanderbilt further expanded his business into a dominant shipping company called the Union Line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 1850s, Vanderbilt had acquired stakes in several railroad companies, including the New York Central Railroad. Vanderbilt&rsquo;s railroads became the first to offer rail service from New York to Chicago in 1873.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vanderbilt was never known for his philanthropy, but he donated $1 million to Central University in Nashville, Tennessee prior to his death. The school would later be renamed Vanderbilt University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of Vanderbilt&rsquo;s death, he was reportedly worth about $100 million, making him the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RitholtzWealth/status/1346064061709103104\">wealthiest person</a> in the world at the time.</p>\r\n"

But, that did not happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legislature has the responsibility to monitor the MRTA&rsquo;s social and economic equity goals by reviewing this plan and the required reports on its implementation, NYS Senator Jeremy Cooney said.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Does The OCM Say?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The agency is reviewing &ldquo;hundreds of pages of notes&rdquo; from more than a dozen community round tables&nbsp;held across the state with representatives from social and economic equity groups, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23561932-klopott-comment-jan3\">said</a> OCM spokesperson Freeman Klopott, who added that the agency&nbsp;will be submitting a report about its &ldquo;social equity-related activities,&rdquo; after analyzing data to determine the locations &ldquo;of more than 1.2 million arrests to analyze communities disproportionately impacted&rdquo; by the drug war and that the plan is expected to be released sometime in the first quarter of 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Paula Collins, an NYC-based attorney who represents cannabis entrepreneurs and investors said: &ldquo;What they may not realize is that there are cannabis professionals &ndash; and ancillary professionals like myself &ndash; who are really looking for these reports for information about how to move forward in this very dynamic space, and we need them to hold themselves accountable to these deadlines.&nbsp;Why should anybody else in this space, like legacy or unlicensed vendors, take heed to the rules that they have set forth &ndash; if they themselves don&rsquo;t stick to the rules?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>No Time To Waste</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A group of business owners formed a coalition that seeks to educate and compel the state&rsquo;s future <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/cannabis/\">cannabis</a> retailers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://newyorkcaurdcoalition.org/\">NY CAURD Coalition</a> aims to teach leadership skills, business basics, and marketing strategies to those interested in entering the industry, and to &ldquo;help legacy transition into the legal market,&rdquo; said Jayson Tantalo, who helped create the coalition and also seeks a Conditional Adult-Use Retail Dispensary (CAURD) license.<br />\r\nNot everything the Office of Cannabis Management promised is coming to fruition &ldquo;so we have to create a system where we&rsquo;re at the forefront,&rdquo; said Jeremy Rivera the group&rsquo;s co-founder and a CAURD applicant as well. &ldquo;We want to make this into generational wealth, but unless we&rsquo;re working together and creating a strong network, once the big players come in &ndash; big money is going to push out little money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As MSN <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/smallbusiness/ny-caurd-coalition-formed-to-educate-assist-cannabis-entrepreneurs-throughout-the-state/ar-AA15XCqA\">reported</a>, there were more than 900 applicants for the state&rsquo;s CAURD program last year, and so far the OCM has only awarded 28 of its <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/04/26647139/ny-gov-kathy-hochul-cannabis-board-approves-first-52-cultivation-licenses-in-the-state\">150 available licenses</a> to individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Get your daily dose of&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"http://www.benzinga.com/cannabis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">cannabis news</a></em><em>&nbsp;on Benzinga Cannabis.

Traders and investors may be sitting on the sidelines until the Labor Department releases initial jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 a.m.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anaysts estimate the number will come in at 223,000 for the week ending Dec. 31.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crypto sector has traded in tandem with the general stock market recently, but Ethereum has shown relative strength, gaining over 10% since Dec. 19. In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 has declined about 0.3% since that date and Bitcoin has gained a mere 0.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Want direct analysis?

Ethereum&rsquo;s most recent higher high was printed on Dec. 22 at $1,238.76 and the most recent higher low was formed at the $1,180.44 mark on Dec. 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Wednesday, Ethereum created another high, but traders will need to see the price action that takes place on Thursday to know whether the next higher high has occurred. If Ethereum closes the trading session with a long upper wick, the crypto may trade lower on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second most likely scenario is that Ethereum forms an inside bar pattern on Thursday, with all of the price action taking place within Wednesday&rsquo;s range. If that occurs, the pattern leans bullish because the crypto was trading higher prior to forming the inside bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bearish traders want to see big bearish pressure come in and break Ethereum down under $1,180, which would negate the uptrend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ethereum has resistance above at $1,308.89 and $1,421.80 and support below at $1,231.28 and $1,081.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"eth_jan._4.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u278075/eth_jan._4.png\" style=\"height:427px; width:760px\" /><em>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/01/30279864/why-crypto-linked-stock-coinbase-is-surging-today\">Why Crypto-Linked Stock Coinbase Is Surging Today</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo via Shutterstock.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n   "

Netflix could be forced to pay up to keep the franchise away from Prime Video. Another option could be that Amazon decides to take the successful series and bring it to its own streaming platform, blocking Netflix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Amazon previously said it wouldn&rsquo;t make all MGM content exclusive on Prime Video, but in the case of this successful show, it could be one of the ultimate battles if Amazon decides to show the strength of its acquisition.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One source told <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2023/01/wednesday-season-2-not-leaving-netflix-amazon-1234795735/\">IndieWire </a>that a deal had been reached between Netflix and MGM for &ldquo;Wednesday&rdquo; before the Amazon deal was closed. That remains to be seen and with Netflix not announcing a second season yet, could still be something for investors and fans of the show to consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/12/30044741/golden-globe-award-nominees-see-the-list-and-which-companies-could-win-big-in-january-2023\">Golden Globe Award Nominees: See The List And Which Companies Could Win Big In January 2023&nbsp;</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why It&rsquo;s Important:</strong> Netflix previously estimates that 150 million households had watched &ldquo;Wednesday,&rdquo; which was more than half of all subscribers.
